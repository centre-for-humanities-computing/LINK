TO R.A.

From this friendly raft of vers 
	libre
I wave, as it were, a shirt, 
Towards Philadelphia. 
Meaning: I read your anonymous rem-
	iniscences,
And I recognize, with a peculiar pleas-
	ure your portrait of me at the 
	blackboard,
Unutterably lost and unhappy among 
	those rows of figures.
But you who were sorry for me, who 
	wanted to help me - 
(A possibility at which I never guessed,
And which, doubtless, would have 
	frightened me quite to death!)
Who, I ask myself, were you?
And finding no answer, I stand up on 
	my frail raft
And signal wistfully toward the hori-
	zon.
