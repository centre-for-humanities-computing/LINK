SONNET

The angle of the morning, garbed in gold, 
	Rose splendidly above the fiery skies 
And shook his hair, coloured in paradise,
Where through the early mists our planet rolled: 
	Above tht morning clouds his trumpet rang.
	 And I, made weary by a sick surmise
Of Love which must remain till Death untold,
Looked off, looked up, and wondered why I sang.

Heart, Heart, you sang that morning; do you hear?
	You sang in ecstacy beneath the noon, 
While the tall tides washed against the pier. . . . 
	The light was fading now; the night came soon, 
And as our songs dided down, and up rose fear,
	The sea rose too, and drenched the hollow moon.
