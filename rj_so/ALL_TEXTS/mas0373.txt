MULBERRY STREET

A small Italian child 
Sits on the curbing,Her little round, brown belly showing 
Through a gap in her torn pink dress.

Her brother squatting beside her
Engrossed in an all-day sucker,Turns sympathetically 
Wipes her nose with the end of his 
	ragged shirt 
And gives her a lick.
