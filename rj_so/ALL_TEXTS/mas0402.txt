THE TENANT FARMER

His lean cattle are luxuriating on his neighbor's 
	green wheat, and presently his neighbor will 
	have them impounded
.His fences are rotten and broken; he is not so shift-
	less as merely discouraged.
Last year he gave one-third of his crop to the land-
	lord, and this year he will give two-fifths
.His corn was late-planted because of the rain, and 
	then it was overtaken by the drought.
If the prices of grain and potatoes rise, the prices of
	shoes and sugar are up betimes before them.
His thirteen hours of work are done, and his wife 
	is on the last of her fifteen.
She has put the children to bed, and is mending 
	overalls by the light of the oil lamp.
Her heavy eyes go shut. She blinks wildly to keep 
	them open, and starts up after each lapse, fierce-
	ly attacking her work.
It is coming on to rain and his roof will leak, and in 
	the lowering dark a mile away his cattle are 
	grazing, rip, rip, rip, reaping great swaths in 
	the green wheat, for every mouthful of which he 
	will have to pay - 
But he knows it not. He is oblivious to all.
He has read for an hour, and now the paper has 
	dropped from his loosened fingers.
Already he with a valiant handful, himself the leader, 
	has somehow, he doesn't clearly remember how,
	taken a hundred yards of enemy trenches.
He is lying in bed, an arm missing. He is exalted 
	in soul but body-shattered, unable to move a 
	muscle - 
And someone has just pinned a decoration upon his
	breast, and he is peeved considerable because he 
	cannot tell and no one will tell him
Whether it is the Victoria Cross, the Iron Cross or
	the Cross of the Legion of Honor.
