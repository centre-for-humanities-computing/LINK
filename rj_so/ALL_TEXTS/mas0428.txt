A SOCIETY WOMAN

I was taught not to take anything 
	seriously
Except dancing and the pursuit of a 
	husband.
My husband will not allow me to have 
	children
Because he admires a pretty figure
And he likes me to preside at his 
	dinner parties. I do it well enough,.
But on rare occasions when I see a 
	dumpy mother
With joy in her eyes and a dirty baby 
	or two clinging to her knees
I wonder if I am not missing some-
	thing.
