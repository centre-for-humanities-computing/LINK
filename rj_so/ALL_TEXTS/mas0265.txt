THE MOTHER

I was a mountain girl, 
I know, now, they call us poor mountain whites; 
There is a school in the valley, 
A college, where my little sister goes: 
I was twelve years old when she was 
	born,And in four years more I was married. 
Married - but I had no courtship and no	romance - 
I married a bloke, like my father and	my brother. 
I could read little and Sue has brought	me books, 
Books that have interpreted to me the 
	unsatisfied, longing ache of the	year:When he asked me to mate up with him	it was only that, 
As an animal might seek his kind; 
The birds and flowers and youth and	spring and love meant nothing to	him:And I (unknowing) married him.

I must have had beauty, then,They say I looked like Sue does now.And - now - when I am coming to know,	through books and Sue, 
How it all might have been, I am faded	and old and coarse, 
My teeth are yellow, my hands hard	with callous; 
My skin has brown patches where once	the roses of spring bloomed.

Sue has a follower, a young professor 
	of the school,Who has taught her, with his fine man-
	ner and easy grace, to be a lady:

He reads poetry  to her, and brings her	roses with dew on them; 
And pictures, one a madonna and child: 
I look and look at it and, then, I look	at my own daughter 
And think of the mother I might have	beenAnd the father I might have given her.

Tonight, i shall tell her of my belated  v
	ision and my dreams of her; 
The callous on my hands shall grow	thicker with toil 
That she may go to the college and learn
	to be a lady.
