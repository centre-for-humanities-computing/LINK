INTROVERSION

What do you seek within, O Soul, my Brother?	What do you seek within? I seek a life that shall never die,	Some haven to win	From mortality.What do you find within, O Soul, my Brother.	What do you find within? I find great quiet where no noises come.	Without, the world's din:	Silence in my home.Whom do you find within, O Soul, my Brother?	Whom do you find within? I find a Friend that in secret came:	His scarred Hands within	He shields a faint flame.What would you do within, O Soul, my Brother?	What would you do within? Bar door and window that none may see: 	That alone we may be 	(Alone! face to face 	In that flame-lit place!)When first we begin To speak one with another.
