THE NEUTRAL

Hated by all for her hypocrisy, 
Made sleek with gain, the Neutral Ally stands, 
Heaping the profits up with eager hands, 
Protesting loud her dread neutrality 
That turns the death of men into a fee - 
A marvel and a hissing to all lands!. . . . 
Woe to her, if the Kaiser's ruthless bands, 
Or the vVorld's Bully, turn the victory!

Faithful to none, and faithless unto all, 
And waxing fat on hatred, woe, and war; 
The clink of counted gold, her bugle call -  
A shell marked U. S. A. her only star -  
What will she do when other bugles sound 
And tramp of angry armies shake the ground?
