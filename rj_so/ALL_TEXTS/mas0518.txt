MENAIA

Silently,
By unseen hands, 
The gates are opened, 
The bands are loosed.

Unbidden, 
Never failing,
In soft inexhorable recurrence 
Always returning, 
Comes mystery 
And possesses me 
And uses me
As the moon uses the waters.

Ebbing and flowing 
Obedient
The tides of my body move; 
Swayed by chronology 
As strict as the waters; 
Unfailing
As the seasons of the moon and the waters.
