AN EPISODE IN LIFE

A touch of the hand;
	A glimpse of two gray eyes and
	the infinite sorrow of them;
A kiss - and the time when two souls
	could look at each other naked,
	plumbing the depths of each; 
Passion rising like whirling flame; 
And then the. torture of one mad, mad
	night, 
Leaving him who was the weaker to 
	face the chaos of the morning!

Dear God, perhaps it was not love.
Or perhaps it was love so deep
That we who shared it could not bear
	to see its promise wane, 
And murdered it, that it might remain
	forever beautiful.
