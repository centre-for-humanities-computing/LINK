SILENT

You lie in death; your flesh that burned 
	In sudden love and sullen heat
	So pitiably does entreat 
Fire and earth lest it be spurned.

You lie as one who longs to flee - 
	Whose limbs would rise and bear him hence -  
	Who, bound in this cold impotence
Stays, yet would go most eagerly.

O hands that touched, O feet that sped 
	Joyfully through the summer day - 
	Farewell! - I hail you on your way
Silently to the silent dead.
