FLIRTATION

He whistled soft whistlings I knew were for 
	me,
Teasing, endearing.
Won't you look? was what they said,
But I did not turn my head.
(Only a little I turned my hearing.)

My feet took me by;
Straight and evenly they went,
As if they had not dreamed what he meant,
As if such a curiosity
Never were known since the world began 
As woman wanting man!

My heart led me past and took me away; 
And yet it was my heart that wanted to stay.
