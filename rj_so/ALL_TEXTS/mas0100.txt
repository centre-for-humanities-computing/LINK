CURSE AND BE MERRY

Speeches and arguments come as 
	they go,
Out of intention and over the board, 
All of them glorious - yea, even so, 
Better, perhaps, than the bomb and the 
	sword.
All of us fall for it, all of us try, 
All of us hate things and fritter and 
	sweat,
All of us reach for things - all of us die -  
And where do we get? Where do we 
	get?

Hot with desire to better the world,
Keen with ambition to thrust and to 
	fight,
Ideals expounded and epithets hurled, 
Seizing our pencils, we fluently write
Stately indictments and graceful ap-
	plause
Routing out smugness and praising the 
	true - 
Manuscripts, manuscripts bolstering a 
	cause - 
But what do we do? What do we do?

Little, too little, but better by far 
Than sitting contented and happy and 
	glad.
Here's to the malcontents, tame as we 
	are,
Here's to the malcontents, merry and 
	mad.
Dream on and argufy - blaspheme and 
	swear,
Letter phillipics in fire and gall, 
Nothing may come of them - what do we 
	care
Nothing at all - nothing at all.
