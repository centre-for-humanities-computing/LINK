TRILIUM

Finding myself in a great' field of 
	Trilium
Indifferently I asked the meaning of
	the three leaves, 
Colored a delightfully frank dingy red. 
They claimed they stood for insou-
	sciance, mockery and madness 
Lying with my face near the ground, I
	kissed them -  
Regardless of their repugnant odor.
