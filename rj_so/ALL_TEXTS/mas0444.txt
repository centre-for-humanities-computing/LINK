DECORATION DAY

	The troops are down in Mexico,
		The Lord is with the fleet - 
	And like a blade the bright parade
		Comes glittering up the street. 
	The banners dip and from each ship!
		Thunders an echoing hail. . . . 
	And yesterday a man who spoke
		On "Peace" was sent to jail!

"Hurrah - hurrah - we bring the jubilee; 
Hurrah - hurrah - the flag that makes us free!"
	
	The troops are down in Mexico,
		A badly-governed land; 
	With warlike speech we go to teach
		The things we understand. 
	Are not all men our brothers,
		And are we not alike? . . . 
	And yesterday we shot a ma
		nFor walking out on strike.

"Hurrah - hurrah - we bring the jubilee; 
Hurrah - hurrah - the flag that makes us free!"
