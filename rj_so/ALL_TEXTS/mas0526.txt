THE GOLD-SPRAYED VOICE OF THE PEOPLE

In the gilded chamber, 
With its cushioned floors and softest draperies, 
Where the heroes of Democracy 
Met in conclave, 
He arose to debate -  
A huge bulk of well-fed manhood, 
With smooth-shaven jowls
That hung like pouches over the glistening band of
	white around the vein-swollen neck, 
His face was stern,
His voice harsh in its deep earnestness,
As he swept the air with a hand jewelled with
	gleaming finger-nails 
And courageously proclaimed his faith in democratic
	ideals:
"Children must be kept at work in the mills, 
If they are to be kept out of jail."
