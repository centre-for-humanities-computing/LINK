THE BRIDGE

I walk the bridge of hours from dawn till night  
	My heart beating so loud with joyous wonder
	To know your love, that I can scarcely breathe,
But in the lonely darkness, with affright 
I faintly hear, like ominous, distant thunder
	The unseen ocean, surging close beneath.

Our bridge, so frail! Eternity, so vast! 
When we must sink into the deep at last, 
Heart of my heart, will you still hold me fast?
