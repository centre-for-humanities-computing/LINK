EN ROUTE

And the train went grumbing 
	on. . . . 
A huge, well-built American occupied  
	a whole car seat, 
And he heldThe dearest, prettiest little girl of a	wife 
On his lap, 
Unashamed. 
And his big faceWreathed with tremendous, silly love 
	smiles,As he watched her sleep. 
It was 11:30 P. M.And the train went grumbling on. . . .
