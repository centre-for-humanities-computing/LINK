ON A HILL

Here there is a golden hill - would that I could sing! 
Here the forest trembles still and the winds bring 
	All the saltness of the sea 
	And its voices unto me.

Here the yellow summer sod and the live-oaks green 
And the clouds with fleetness shod and the leafy sheen
	All are moving, only I
	Motionless in silence lie.

And I think that I am dead, cold to everything;
Yet the flowers are gold and red; would that I could sing!
	Or that stealthily the sea
	Would drown the tired heart of me.
