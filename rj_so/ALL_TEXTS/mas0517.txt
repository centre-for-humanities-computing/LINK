LIVING

O do not fear thy life,
	Do not fear: 
Do not draw back
	When life draws near.

Eager, unfaltering,
	As a bride to her lover; 
With joy, with desire
	Give thyself over.

Faithfully, proudly,
	As a steadfast wife; 
And jocundly
	Live with thy life.

Do not fear his look,
	Fling glance for glance: 
Is it adventure,
	Is it mischance - 

Leave all to life,
	To life, thy lord, 
And wait on his will: with gladness
	Wait on his word.

Give him thy deepest,
	Stake thy best; 
And grow ripe with his fruitage,
	Grow young with his zest.

For thy zest of life
	Is thy hold on youth; 
For thy zest of life
	Is thy hold on truth.
