THE LAUGHERS

Spring! 
And her hidden bugles up the street. 
Spring - and the sweet 
Laughter of winds at the crossing; 
Laughter of birds and a Fountain tossing 
Its hair in abandoned ecstasies. 
Laughter of trees.
Laughter of shop-girls that giggle and blush; 
Laugh of the tug-boat's impertinent fife.
 Laughter Followed by a trembling hush -  
Laughter of love, scarce whispered aloud. 
Then, stilled by no sacredness or strife, 
Laughter that leaps From the crowd; 
Seizing the world in a rush. 
Laughter of life. . . .

Earth takes deep breaths like a man who had
	feared he might smother, 
Filling his lungs before bursting into a
	shout. . . . 
Windows are opened - curtains flying out; 
Over the wash-lines women call to each other. 
And, under the calling, there surges, too clearly
	to doubt, 
Spring, with the noises 
Of shrill, little voices; 
Joining in "Tag" and the Furious chase 
O "I-spy," "Red Rover" and "Prisoner's
	Base";
Of the roller-skates whir at the sidewalk's 
	slope,
Of boys playing marbles and girls skipping 
	rope.
And there, down the avenue, behold, 
The First true herald of the Spring -  
The hand-organ gasping and wheezily mur-
	muring
Its tunes ten-years old. . . . 
And the music, trivial and tawdry, has fresh-
	ness and magical swing. 
And over and under it,
 During and after - 
The laughter 
Of Spring! . . .

And lifted still
With the common thrill,
With the throbbing air, the tingling vapor,
That rose like strong and mingled wines;
I turned to my paper,
And read these lines:
"Now that the Spring is here,
The war enters its bloodiest phase. . . .
The men are impatient. . . .
Bad roads, storms and the rigors of the winter
Have held back the contending armies. . . .
But the recruits have arrived,
And are waiting only the First days of warm
	weather. . . . 
There will be terrible Fighting along the whole
	line - 
Now that Spring has come." 

I put the paper down. . . .
Something struck out the sun - something un-
	seen;
Something arose like a dark wave to drown 
The golden streets with a sickly green. 
Something polluted the blossoming day 
With the touch of decay. 
The music thinned and died; 
People seemed hollow-eyed. 
Even the Faces of children, where gaiety lin-
	gers,
Sagged and drooped like banners about to be 
	furled - 
And Silence laid its bony fingers
On the lips of the world . . .
A grisly quiet with the power to choke;
A quiet that only one thing broke;
One thing alone rose up thereafter . . .
Laughter!
Laughter of streams running red.
 Laughter of evil things in the night; 
Vultures carousing over the dead; 
Laughter of ghouls. 
Chuckling of idiots, cursed with sight. 
Laughter of dark and horrible pools. 
Scream of the bullets' rattling mirth, 
Sweeping the earth.
Laugh of the cannon's poisonous breath. . . . 
And over the shouts and the wreckage and
	crumbling 
The raucous and rumbling
Laughter of death. 
Death that arises to sing, -  
Hailing the Spring!
