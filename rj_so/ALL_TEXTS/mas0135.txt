CONVENTIONAL LIFE

		Midnight is come, 
And thinly in the deepness of the gloom 
Truth rises startle-eyed out of a tomb,
		And we are dumb.

		A death-bell tolls, 
And we still shudder round the too smooth bed, 
For Truth makes pallid watch above the dead,
		Freezing our souls.

		But day returns, 
Light and the garish life, and we are brave, 
For Truth sinks wanly down into her grave.
		Yet the heart yearns.
