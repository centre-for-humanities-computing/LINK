THE PLAIN CLOTHES MAN SPEAKS

I am a plain clothes slugger. 
I love my work. I do it better than I am told. 
The money is good, property pays it, 
The people pay property, and I slug the people. 
I am a working man. 
They call me Judas, 
But they are wrong:
I love the money, but I love my work still more. 
No wolf ever tore a hare that loved more the blood 
Than I love to club the quivering flesh of the weak. 
I have no fear of a ragged creature faint with hunger; 
Let him strike back - if he dare. 
I love a carnival of blood,
But it is not safe to club one's fellow citizens 
Unless the City of New York gives me a star 
To hide beneath my civilian coat. 
Then no anguished eyes need look to me 
For mercy.
I love to see a victim struggle, small though he be,
In the grip of a bluecoat,
And then slug him with my bare fist - 
To silence.
One day when I did this,
Saturday, April the fourth,
On East Sixteenth
Near Union Square,
A fellow called me a coward
And then, with a trusty assistant on each side, 
I hit him.
So help me God, I did.
