HIGH-TIDE

I edged back against the night.
The sea growled assault on the wave-bitten shore. 
And the breakers,
Like young and impatient hounds, 
Sprang, with rough joy, on the shrinking sand. 
Sprang - but were drawn back slowly, 
With a long, relentless pull, 
Whimpering, into the dark.

Then I saw who held them captive;
And I saw how they were bound
With a broad and quivering leash of light,
Held by the moon,
As, calm and unsmiling,
She walked the deep fields of the sky.
