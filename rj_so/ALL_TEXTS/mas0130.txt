EBONY

I am an American NiggerAnd a clean one. 
My ancestors washed themselves 
Every day in a clear river 
And I am worthy of them. 
It is the pet horror of my life 
To be thrown with the grimy whites, 
To see their repulsive hands and nails	and necksAnd to smell the odor of their per-
	spiration. 
I am a clean Nigger 
And I pay for it.
