MANHATTAN

We contemplate with pride our vast researches,
 Then turn highwaymen for our wives and wenches.
We meet as bosom friends in clubs and churches, 
As foes again we meet in trades and trenches. 
Our subways run with subterranean lurches. 
Our City Hall's the abode of all the virtues, -  
Off with the lid and air the swarm of stenches. 
We toot, we loot, yet full are all park benches.
 Our daily papers blare out smuts and smirches. 
The drivel flows on tap in dribs and drenches 
And brothels, slums, morgues, keyholes, sewers, 
	searches,
Though not one bit our tipsy pride it wrenches
Or jars us off our dirty, lofty perches, - 
While we can quaff those queer Manhattan quenches.
