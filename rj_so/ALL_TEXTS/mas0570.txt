BREATHLESS

Why am I breathless? 
Why fainting and trembling, 
Almost stopping in fear? 

Do you not know 
That at any moment 
I may turn some corner in this road, 
And, like death meeting life, 
May come face to face 
With you? 

Ah, why am I breathless then?               
Is it this - that you may be kind -  
Or this - that you may turn 
And pass me by 
Carrying your head high?
