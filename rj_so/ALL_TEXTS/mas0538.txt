ZANESVILLE

I will not be like the unaspiring hills, 
Whence the sour clay is taken,
To be moulded by the shape-loving fingers of Man 
Into vases and cups of an old pattern.

But I will be my own creator,
Dragging myself from the clinging mud,
And mould myself into fresh and lovelier shapes
To celebrate my passion for Beauty.
