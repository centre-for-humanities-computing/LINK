ADVENT

Out of the night, out of the night - 
	When the dark small hours are weirdly still,
	 And the air grows chill, 
And the last of the stars prepare for
	flight - 
Out of the hush of the summer night 
Breaks the lone brave voice of a far-
	off bird, 
	But dimly heard : 
"Awake, ye sleepers !" 
		- The feathered throng 
In the heart of my garden is strangely 
	stirred - 
"Awake, ye sleepers, and strew with 
	song
The path of the coming Light!"
	At his word 
They awaken - the myriad singers - one 
	by one
Adding a warble, a whistle, a trill to
	the chant begun, 
Till the night grows faint 'neath the
	whelming burden of singing, 
And slow gray dawn creeps in, all
	misty-spun, 
And troubles the drowsy world, to a
	dream-life clinging, 
	With word of the Sun.
