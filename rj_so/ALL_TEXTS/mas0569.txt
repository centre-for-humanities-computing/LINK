ON READING THE NEW REPUBLIC

Ah pause, Appreciation, here 
	Sophistication doubly nice is; 
See polished paragraph appear 
	Anent some cataclysmic crisis. 

Note raw-boned, rude, impulsive
	 	thought 
	Arrested here and subtly twitted; 
Note youth comporting as he ought, 
	And naked truth correctly fitted.              

Not passion's stress, but aftermath! 
	Opinion's peaceful realignment! 
Here ordered logic takes its path 
	Along the line of most refinement. 

To tune the nation's raucous voice 
	Be these the accents sorely needed; 
A calm discriminating choice 
	By pleasant dalliance preceded. 

And here beyond the stir of strife, 
	Where distant drones the blatant 
		babble,               
Ah, tread the promenade of life 
	A pace behind the vulgar rabble.
