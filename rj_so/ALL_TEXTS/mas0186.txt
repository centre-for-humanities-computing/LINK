THE FERRY PEOPLE

		I.Hard by the slips the liners tug at their cables' endsWhile dock and deck and gang-plank hear friends' goodbyes to friends:O careless, lucky nation to sail and sail awayAnd wander round the wonder world forever and a day!But we are the Ferry People and never shall we go freeTo spy from their lordly liners the glint of the farthest sea.

		II.Yes, we are the Ferry people, the slaves of the daily wage,Who travel aboard the ferries as a man might ride on a stage:Bridges there are and tunnels and airships (coming) in shoals,But we cross the river by ferry for the sake of our heartmost souls."Weary, I wait," the Voice cries that will not let us be,"For I am the Sea your Mother‚Äîand have you forgotten me?

		III."And I am the Sea your Mother - your fathers found me sweet
For they left the fire o' the hearthstone to follow my dancing feet; Norsemen and Celt and Saxon, Latin and men from Tyre, 
To taste of my secret beauty, to conquer my lip-spoke ire. 
Quick their blood in your bodies and why should you not go free? 
And I am the Sea your Mother - and have you forgotten me?

		IV.But we are the Ferry People, our watches close to our hand, 
(We're running on time this morning‚Äîjust two more minutes to land) 
And once on the earth Lord love us! how the ferry fancies fade! 
In that rocking ride up the subway and the hum of the wheels of trade 
And we'll never do any different from now till the dismal dark 
When we'll live in our children's houses in Something-or-Other Park.

		V.Dim eyes...dull ears...and the finish...The finish? or shall there riseThe voice of the wave-lipped woman crooning in tenderwise:"Sons of my heart awaken! long have you drowsed ashore.Long have you dreamed of my luring‚Äînow shall you dream no more,Sons of my heart awaken! sons of my heart go free!I am the Sea your Mother - and have you forgotten me?"
