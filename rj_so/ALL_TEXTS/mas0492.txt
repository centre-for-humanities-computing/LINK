FREEDOM

While the parrots gnaw 
At the wires of their cage 
And squall for freedom, 
And a red-headed bird 
Marked "sold" 
Flops around in his cage 
And peers with an eye 
Through the meshes of wire 
Craving freedom, 
And the gold fish 
Flutter and flounce 
As a man with a syphon 
Cleanses their water, 
The parrakeets sit 
In a row on their perch 
Like birds of wood 
Painted yellow and green. 
No squawk or beating of wings 
Against wire 
From the parrakeets. 
They are the philosophers: 
"So long as we sit 
In a row on our perch, 
The wires of our cage 
Might as well not exist. 
So long as we sit 
We have perfect freedom."
