THE FIXTURE

She is always there,This long, rangy figure 
Of sapped-out middle age virginity. 
Her moldy-colored, angular face 
Is stitched with a thousand seams, 
And her thin, bloodless lips 
Twitch incessantly 
Until her countenance 
Assumes the quality of a flexible mask.

She patters on tip-toe along the marble floorAnd guides her queer squintAlong the row of "new" books.With an open smile of triumphHer colorless hand with its long talonsDarts outAnd seizes upon a volume 
Bearing the title: 
"A Modern Mother."
