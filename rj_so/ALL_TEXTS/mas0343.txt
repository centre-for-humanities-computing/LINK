DUMB, BUT WELL-DRESSED

A dandy, pert little fellow 
Talked to me the other day.
He was sunny and breezy,
Clever, glib of tongue and well-bred. 
But he didn't say anything. 
All the time he was talking 
I had a mental picture of him
Strutting up a conventional fifth Avenue of Thought: 
Out with his Ego on a leash 
For an afternoon's airing.
