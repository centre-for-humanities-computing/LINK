BEREFT

O, brown Earth, warm and fragrant, 
	Make soft her tiny bed, 
	Oh, great Winds, in the darkness 
		Move gently overhead - 

Be kind, you waving grasses
	She gathered baby-wise, 
And all you buds and blossoms,
	Rest lightly on her eyes.

Oh, mothers, to your bosoms
	 Fold close and safe your own - 
My little babe is sleeping
	 Beneath the stars . . . alone.
