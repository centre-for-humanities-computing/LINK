FROM HARRY IN ENGLAND

With wrath and anguish in my heartI'm picking England's life apart. 
I'm picking oakum in my need 
While my fingers ache and bleed. 
I pick till madness fires my head; 
I pick until my soul goes dead. 
Picking oakum? No, 'tis worse, 
Though no eye can see the curse - 
With wrath and anguish in my heart,
I'm picking England's self apart.
