DEATH MASKS

You say that the white of his face in the darkness 
		gleamed strangely, 
	As touched by a light 
That is seen of the faces of those who die greatly, 
		whose honor 
	Gave all for the right; 
And you bring me his sword and his sash, and the
		 message of comrades,
	 All that they know 
Of the last of the hours that he spent on the earth. 
		Me, his mother -  
	You comfort me so - 

And I tell you you lie!

I tell you the last that he knew of this earth was its
		 hatred and anger; 
	Blood blinded his eyes; 
What gleamed white in the dark was the tightly-
		clenched teeth of his raging, 
	Cursing the skies, 
For his face was as blackened, awry, as the soul 
		they tore from him -  
	Hurled to God's feet, 
A devil, the horrible madness of murder upon him -  
	My son, who was sweet!
