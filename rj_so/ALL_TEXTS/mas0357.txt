MODERN LOVE LETTER

Put your wooden arms around me, 
	Hold me in a cork embrace.
 Let me kiss that northeast section
	Where you used to keep your face. 
You are mine and mine forever,
	Darling patriotic boob: 
And my lips they long to press the
	End of that new silver tube. 
Get yourself all tied together,
	Fly to me by parcels post. 
Whom the Lord hath put asunder
	I would join - at least, almost.
