WORLD'S END

In spite of Grenstone, men will roam,
	Such men as Hercules, 
But there are orchards nearer home 
	Which are Hesperides.

Where can the whole world farther lie
	Than where these branches are 
That daily dally with the sky
	And nightly hold a star?

Plucking gold fruit and old renown,
	Would that be better labour 
Than borrowing apples red and brown
	From an unacquainted neighbor?

O where I lie adventure lies!
	And see! - a farmer's wagon 
Conveys at last before my eyes
	Two daughters of the dragon.

And she, the lovelier of the two,
	Shall seek among the trees -  
O never doubt that I shall do
	As well as Hercules!
