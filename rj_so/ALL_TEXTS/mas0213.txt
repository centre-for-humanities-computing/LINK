BIRTH

New Year Eve - Quivering awe 
	and reverence possess me, as
	though I await the approach of
	something beautifully humane. 
Reminiscences appear out of the Past-
	as a flock of birds - they dart, dash,
	soar. 
	They are gone. 
I submit to the ominous approach of
	the Future.

Vibrating whistles, 
Sirens,
Vortex of silly voices, inane merry-
	makers
Welcoming what? A New bottle of 
	Champagne?
