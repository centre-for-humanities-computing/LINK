ANY CITY

Into the staring street 
	She goes on her nightly round, 
With weary and tireless feet 
	Over the wretched ground.

A thing that man never spurns, 
	A thing that all men despise;Into her soul there burns	The street with its pitiless eyes.

She needs no charm or wile;	She carries no beauty or power,
But a tawdry and casual smile	For a tawdry and casual hour.

The street with its pitiless eyes 
	Follows wherever she lurks,But she is hardened and wise - 	She rattles her bracelets, and smirks.

She goes with her sordid array,	Luring, without a lure; 
She is man's hunger and prey - 	His lust and its hideous cure.

All that she knows are the lies, 
	The evil, the squalor, the scars;The street with its pitiless eyes, 
	The night with its pitiless stars.
