RELEASE

Charming to drift about the streets
In the early evening,
Not thinking but simply accepting 
The flattery of one's amusing sensations; 
This is to be oneself a poem - 
Pleasanter than writing them.

The people passing
Have put off the egoism
With which day invests them;
Vague accidents of a dream,
Like comfortable animals one keeps
To take the chill off solitude,
They pass,
They make no demands.

I like the electric glare 
That cuts the pavement in clean blocks, 
Like the touch of the wind slipping past 
With still some sweetness of fields to scatter, 
But the straying aroma of cigarettes 
Amuses me more -  
Pricks with a tang of sex, 
Caressing, not gross,
Like the perfumed things they lean to say,
For saying,
On terraces,
Beneath an easy moon.

I am sorry the lassies with their horrible drum
Must find it all so fierce and solemn,
That's their pleasure, I prefer
The bold lights capering, sans gene,
Up there
On the stage from which the proud, accusing stars 
Have withdrawn.
