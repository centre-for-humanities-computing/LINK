YOU

A million feet dragging on the hollow walks; 
Filthy dust
Of horses dung and grease 
Before a moving wind;
The boom-boom of swaying trucks across the pave-
	ments;
The shrieking of new born buildings, 
Vomiting smoke and sound, 
Leaping, 
Crying to God;
Heavy lumbering cars whanging around corners;
A traffic policeman with his hand upheld - 
And still
I have forgotten all
Except your eyes - 
Green as a sunflecked sea.
Your nearness smothers me with Happiness.
And oh the sweetness of your breath
Upon my mouth.
