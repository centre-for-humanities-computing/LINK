THE BROTHER-CRY

Out of the depth I cry unto thee, 
		O brother-man! 
	Not unto God who sits afar, 
	Beyond the distant sky and star, 
	Or mingles, as some mortals say, 
	In every stone and flower and ray 
		And murmuring sea; 
But unto thee, who, knowing, can 
Relieve the burden of my toil, 
Speak words that midst the ceaseless 
		moilWould lift my spirit from the soil 
		And show me light. 
	Light! - How little here below 
	Where I, enslaved, dim of sight, 
	Delve in the dark, and slow - so 
		slow! -  
			Reach death's night.

Thou who wouldst answer to Duty's 
	call,		Brother of mine, 
Know that she cries, Go doom! Go 
		down!Down where the millions, furrowed	and brown, 
Strain with never a hope of a crown, - 
	Shackled all. 
	Thou who dost prate of Things 
		Above,			Poet and Priest, 
How canst thou speak of a heavenly 
		love,Of the voice of peace on the wings	of a dove, 
While underneath I hoist and shove,	Unreleased? 
Know that the dove abhors the smell 
Of the dungeon-keep where I dying	dwell;		And I've learned full well, 
		As my curses swell, 
That God and His love live far from
	 Hell!

Ah, once I stood on the great highway	Where fine folk go, 
And I saw the stately men go by,
 And dames that dazzled my famished 
	eye,And the laugh of children rang out 
	high;And my soul burned in me aloud to cry
	 My cruel woe! 
	For I thought of my brothers who	that same day 
	Were cursing the God who formed 
		their clay			So little different from these. 
And a bitter tear cleansed my black 
	cheek;I wailed - but the laughter drowned my 
	shriek -  
		"Aye, spend as ye please 
		In frolics and glees, 
	And flash in your gilded car! 
		But your golden flood 
		Is your brother's blood 
	Who slaves in your hells afar!"

And I turned me in scorn and backward 
	went,		To spend and be spent.

Brother of mine, O brother of mine,	Out of the depths I cry unto thee! -  
Down where I struggle and sorrow and
	 pine,Down where men's blood is drunk like 
	wine,Send not thy God with His piety! 
But send thyself! and mayhap then, 
		When I have seen 
		Of blood-stain clean 
			A Man,There'll creep to my slow-waking ken 
The meaning of what is uttered when 
Thou speakest of love thy God bore 
	men		Since time began.
