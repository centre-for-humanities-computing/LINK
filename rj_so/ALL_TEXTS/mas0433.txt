THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SMALL TOWN GIRL

The neighbors talked about him 
	glowingly, 
And in the Spring he spoke to me
Walking in the woods
Among the hepaticas and kisses.

In the Summer
The golden-rods waved on the hills, 
And he said good-bye.

In Autumn I couldn't walk in the 
	woods
For the dizziness that came over me.
And he was gone.

Then the neighbors started talking 
	about me.
