THE LIPS OF MY LOVER

To the lips of my lover, my eyes give heed, 
His whole soul-life in their lines I read! 
Rebellious, full, - the nether one tells  
Of wayward spirit that in him dwells, 
An eager, tumultuous, ardent child, 
By all of the warmth of life beguiled! 
It calls to the mother-love, half-divine, 
That dwells in me, and it makes him 
	mine! 

Close pressed on its warm, rebellious 
	mate,      
The other lies firm and grim as fate, - 
Firm in the cause of the poor and weak, 
Grim on the trail of the strong and 
	sleek!                 
It tells of a spirit austere, aloof, - 
Of stern old Puritan sires, the proof! 
It calls to the pulsing woman in me,                
It makes me his, - till the end shall be!
