WHEN SPRING CAME UP THE APRIL HILL

Oh for the top of an April hill,Now that the soft wet winds are	blowing,Wild as a child who will not be still,	Mad to be going--going--going!

(What a sight for spring to see, oh God! - A crimson sea, a crimson sod, 
A gaunt earth torn with festering	trenches,	Deaf with the roar and sick with the 
	stenches.)

Oh for the top of an April hill,Now that the soft white buds are spray-
	ing,	Wild as a child with a child's sweet 
	will, Mad to be maying--maying--maying!

(What a sight for spring to see, oh 
	God! - A crimson sea, a crimson sod,The music stilled, the singers crushed, 
The lilting mouths of childhood 
	hushed.)	

When spring came up the April hill, With petal breaths and petals flying,A million men lay white and still Afar . . . a million mothers crying.
