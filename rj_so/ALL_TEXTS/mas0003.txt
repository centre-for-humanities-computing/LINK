THE SONGS OF TO-DAY

ing me the song of To-day, 
The living throb and the pulses,The tides of the ocean of Truth. 
Sing me the song of the Hour, 
Burdened with breathing humanity, 
With the rage and the hope and the 
	sorrow,The vast mysterious impulse -  
The tumult of Life!You have sung of the Past and its 
	heroes,Of the prowess of Kings and Princes, 
Bearing triumphant their falchions; 
Victors, cheered by the world! 
You have chanted of deeds in the battle, 
Of giants that knew no defeat! 
But long has Death been their victor, 
And their strength has been lulled to 
	Sleep,
Of them but their names enduring, 
Writ in the dream of man!I yearn for the song of my brothers, 
That struggle with me to-day! 
The song of the man and woman, 
That die in the battle for bread! 
Sing me the song of the heroes, 
That conquer the Earth with their toil; 
The song of the hearts that are bleed-
	ingTo lighten the burden of Man; 
The song of the prophets proclaiming 
A Kingdom of Truth and of Love! 
Sing me of them that are weary, 
Of them that have battled and failed, 
And languish alone and unnoticed; 
Sing me the by-street and alley, T
he spawn of Greed and of Shame!I long to hear of my brothers - The men, and women, and children,That hope and win and fall!I long to hear the musicOf the hour as it lives,Of the pulses of the myriad bosoms,Proclaiming the Truth of the Day!Sing me the Song of To-day; 
The song of the Hour that lives, 
Mingling with vibrant music 
The song of the Future and Hope, 
The song of mankind ennobled 
In the glory of Truth and of Love!
