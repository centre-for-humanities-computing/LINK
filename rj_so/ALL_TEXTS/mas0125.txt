SUMMER

		I.The world - a green valleyFull of morning sunlight and deep cool shadow, 
Lovely by-paths half hidden, 
And the glimmer of white knees 
Dancing toward me.

		II.Cool clasping handsAnd fragrant, unperturbed mouth,Lovely and unconscious bosomStillGlad, free, indifferent . . . 
Only your eyes 
Question me . . .

		III.Who knows?Pain, as of old,Anger and self-mockeryAnd the shame of things spoiled forever . . . 
Or joy laughing forgetfully 
In Eden. 
Who dares?		IV.Fool that I am, who desire 
Neither.
Only perpetually your cool hands 
And lovely laughing mouth,White knees that have brushed the cold dew from	the grasses, 
And the unstirred peace of your bosom.
