I, A MINOR POET

I do not like my songs.
	I want to voice the joy of life, 
The splendor of action, the clarion-call of beauty, the
	transport of dreams,
 The fun of this great high-hearted adventure, 
The rapture of being alive, 
But whenever I open my mouth to sing, 
Out comes a plaintive wail.
Confound it!
