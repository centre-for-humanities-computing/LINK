SISTERS OF THE CROSS OF SHAME

The Sisters of the Cross of Shame,
	They smile along the night;
Their houses stand with shuttered souls 
	And painted eyes of light.

Their houses look with scarlet eyes 
	Upon a world of sin;
And every man cries, "Woe, alas!
	"And every man goes in.

The sober Senate meets at noon,
	To pass the Woman's Law,
The portly Churchmen vote to stem 
	The torrent with a straw.

The Sister of the Cross of Shame,
	She smiles beneath her cloud - 
(She does not laugh till ten o'clock,
	And then she laughs too loud.)

And still she hears the throb of feet 
	Upon the scarlet stair,
And still she dons the cloak of shame 
	That is not hers to wear.

The sons of saintly women come 
	To kiss the Cross of Shame;
Before them, in another time,
	Their worthy fathers came.

And no man tells his son the truth,
	And no man dares to tell;
And Innocence goes laughing through 
	The little doors of hell. . .

The Sisters of the Cross of Shame,
	They smile along the night,
And on their shadowed window sills,
	They place a scarlet light - 

They place a scarlet light to draw 
	The soul that flutters by - 
And still the portly Churchman prays,
	And still the young men die.

And still the portly Churchmen pray,
	And still the Senate meets,
And still the scarlet houses stand 
	Along the bitter streets - 

And no man tells his son the truth,
	Lest he should speak of sin;
And every man cries, "Woe, alas!"
	And every man goes in.
