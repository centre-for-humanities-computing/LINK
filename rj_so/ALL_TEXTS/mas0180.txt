SUFFERING POLAND

"The flame stifled - that great,  
	princely, artistic people, -Those temperaments of incalculable 
	worth, -The throbbing, imperishable heart of 
	PolandTorn out by the roots and rent apart by 
	swine,By swine, I say, - worse than swine!" 
	(for you were angry!)

I bowed my head -  
And then I said,"A Hunky would have a temperament, 
	perhaps,If a Hunky ever had time for a tem-
	perament,Here as there . . .I believe the Hunkies are Poles?They were wise, you see.They sickened of tyrannyOf Junkertum, of oppression, - they be-
	came awareThat we,Over here, were free -
Had souls!"Bayonne ! ..." I murmured. "Christ!	. . . if they only knew. . . ." 
But "Oh," you said, "don't you think	that is different too? . . ."
