THE CONQUERORS

Deep runs this credo in my soul:	Failing, they fail not who have tried;Lesser than they shall gain the goal -  
	Greater than they have wept and 
		died.

Sans tears or thorns or wreck or wrath 
	Runs that smooth way that ends in		mire,But only by the Bleeding Path 
	May brave hearts seek the heart's 
		desire.

Forgotten, they are not forgot,
	Dying, they die not in that Way;Nor their dream any ink shall blot 
	Or sword shall quench or bars shall 
		stay.
