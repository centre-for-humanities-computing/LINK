THE THREE DREAMS

The Dream of God:
I have created a world, 
And men can devise no changes my heart could for-
	give;
I have shorn them of power,
And so I feed them with visions to make it less hateful 
	to live.

The Dream of Man:
I have come out of the depths,
And no one shall carry the burden I cast from my 
	back;
I have ascended the heights,
And simple as simple to follow the light I lit on my 
	track.

The Dream of Woman:
I was the plaything of beasts,
And now I have chained their desires and escaped from
	my den; 
I was the servant of life,
And now I shall never be happy until I share it with
	men.
