ENCHANT OUR EYES

The god, to whom the wild vine 
	clings,
Half-heard in piping minstrelsy
 Flees from our new imaginings.

The sleeping girl Persephone,
	Hidden in grass and growing things -  
Once seen of us, - ah where is she?

In the twilight enshadowed wings 
	That drifting shape of mystery 
Who through the pines his anthem sings;

Where have they fled? Ah - phantasy -  
	Grey magic that the west-wind 
		brings
Enchant our eyes again to see!
