COMRADE JESUS

Thanks to Saint Matthew, who had been
At mass-meetings in Palestine, 
We know whose side was spoken for 
When Comrade Jesus had the floor.

"Where sore they toil and hard they lie, 
Among the great unwashed, dwell I. 
The tramp, the convict, I am he; 
Cold-shoulder him, cold-shoulder me."

By Dives' door, with thoughtful eye,
He did to-morrow prophesy: -
"The Kingdom's gate is low and small;
The rich can scarce wedge through at all."

"A dangerous man," said Caiaphas; 
"An ignorant demagogue, alas,
 Friend of low women, it is he 
Slanders the upright Pharisee."

For law and order, it was plain,
 For holy Church, he must be slain. 
The troops were there to awe the crowd, 
And violence was not allowed.

Their foolish force with force to foil, 
His strong, clean hands he would not soil.
 He saw their childishness quite plain 
Between the lightnings of his pain

.Between the twilights of his end
 He made his fellow-felon friend; 
With swollen tongue and blinding eyes, 
Invited him to Paradise.

Ah, let no Local him refuse; 
Comrade Jesus hath paid his dues. 
Whatever other be debarred,
 Comrade Jesus hath his red card.
