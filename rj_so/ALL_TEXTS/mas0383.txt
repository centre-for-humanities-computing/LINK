LATER SPRING

A spring day of the long ago. . . . 
I live again its wine-rich hours; 
Against my face its low winds blow 
The poignancy of promised flowers. . . .

I stifle - stifle in such air! 
For countless frosts and myriad snows 
Have made so rare - so crying rare 
That spring-breath of the long ago!
