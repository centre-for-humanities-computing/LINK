PORTRAIT OF A JEWELRY DRUMMER

Adventure hangs about him, like a friend; 
	Romance he buys and sells‚Äîon six months' 
		time.
	In his small wallet Lust and heedless Crime 
Come to a safe and profitable end. 
Rubies, torn from the eyes of idols, blend
	With virgin pearls, fresh from the ageless 
		slime.
	And lives and hazards, perilous and sublime, 
Are this man's power - and his dividend.

The diver's death becomes his daily bread; 
	The smallest of his opals burn and glow 
		With all the stubborn agonies of strife. . . 
We spoke of men and hardships. "Well," he 
			said,
	"This travelling is the meanest work I know. 
		Small towns and sleepers‚Äîit's a dog's own 
			life!"
