TO THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND

While you weep
For your men, blind, legless, broken 
Or only dead perhaps -  
While you despair - 

We dance and shop
And feel annoyance when upon the street 
They hold a box for pennies in our faces 
And beg for food for little children 
And bandages and socks 
For soldiers somewhere

.And you raise your heads
Eyes dull with tears and peer across the sea
In wonder at our callousness.

We women have a right to dance and shop 
And to refuse you pennies. 
We have never -  
Yet - 
Pinned a feather on a boy and killed him.
