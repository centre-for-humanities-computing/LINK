THE YOUNG GIRL WITH RED HAIR

I AM reminded of her, as a clearly-carven cameo
Reminds one of strange other lands. 
The shadow of her ruddy hair
 Over her old-young eyes' unshaking glow -  
The nervous slender seeking hands -  
The thin mouth that so secretly 
Upon its dreaming smiled and smiled -  
The slender flanks, the cool white hips and feet -  
This autumn day has brought them back to me: 
Were you, then, so sweet, 
O strange and delicately haggard child?
