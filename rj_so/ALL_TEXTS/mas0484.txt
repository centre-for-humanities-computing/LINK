BATTLE HYMN OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC

God, give us strength these days - 
	Burn us with one desire; 
To smother this murderous blaze, 
	Beat back these flames with fire.

Let us not weaken and fail 
	Or spend ourselves in a shout;
Let our white passion prevail 
	Till the terror is driven out.

Give us the power to fling
	Ourselves and our fury, employed 
To blast and destroy this thing
	Lest Life itself be destroyed.

Friends in all lands, arise -  
	Turn all these fires to shake
Against their refuge of lies; 
	Force it to crumble and break.

Rise, ere it grow too late
	And we have not strength enough. 
Sweep it down with our hate!
	Trample it with our love!
