IN THE HALLWAY

My poor little sister -    
Why must she always meet her 
	lover in the hallway - 
Starting at every sound she hears
In the midst of her shy, sweet kisses.
Sometimes a dark, menacing figure 
	passes them . . .
They draw apart, standing stiff and con-
	scious - 
Her lover mumbles something indis-
	tinct . . .
She laughs a nervous laugh ...
The shadow vanishes . . .
They draw together again - 
Somewhere a door is shut - a loud lock 
	clicks. . . 
My sister stirs and sighs. . . .

And now, a little later, here she stands -  
Undressing before the mirror - 
Rays from an outer room frame her in 
	light - 
Her hair is a cloud of shadow round her 
	head - 
Her eyes, adream and soft and wonder-
	ing - 
Her lips, touched with a sweet expec-
	tancy . . . 
Her form with all the tender little 
	curves
Of adolescence passed just yesterday -  
Her soul lit with the sheer, young joy of
	living . . . 
My poor little sister?
