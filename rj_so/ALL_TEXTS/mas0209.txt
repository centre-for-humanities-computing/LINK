COURAGE

Always, I have been afraid of Life. 
	A child, I feared the dark. I 
	walked alone into its soft engulfing 
	blackness.
And I have feared this big world's give 
	and take - feared to match my mind, 
	my strength against the minds, the 
	strength of other men. No one has
	 guessed.
I was afraid of love. I took its chance.
I feared the agony, the ecstasy, the sac-
	rifice, the priceless prize of mother-
	hood. I chose them.
I am afraid of age. Age, you are bring-
	ing gifts to me, I go to meet you.
I am afraid of death. Death, I wait for
	you.
