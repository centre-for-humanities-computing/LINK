WHEN SLEEPING SHALL MINE EYELIDS CLOSE

Some day when sleeping shall mine eyelids close 
	And rob my breathing of its old intent, 
Shalt thou spring near my couch, reflective Rose
	,And know where my released spirit went?
Hast thou untrammeled sense with which to pierce
	The film too dense for visioning of men? 
Canst thou in perfumed flight outride the fierce
	And conscious questioning of Where and When? 
When I have lain me down to sleep my last
	Long sleep, I may shrink back in pale affright. 
Then, comrade Rose, until my fears have passed,
	Upbear me with thee in thy fragrant flight -  
And as a godspeed to the untried land 
Drop thou a warming petal in my hand.
