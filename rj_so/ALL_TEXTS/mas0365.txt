APRILLE'S LOVE SONG

You come to me across the wet 
	meadows,All Youth in your footsteps,All Youth and all Age in your eyes 
	that sing low to me,As they catch my scarf's flutter 
Among the young trees;You are Day-break,The fragrance of locust-tree blossoms 
Dropping down upon me;

And I run to meet you;My love carries my feet to you all 
	winged;I cannot stay: no more can the Wind 
	stayIts flying skirts through the tree-tops.

I come to meet the melody of your 
	heart's song:In the sweet mad rush of your arms to 
	enfold me,Music is born, and all singing things: 
The shy little cricket,The lark up yonder against the breast of a 
	cloud, - They sing for the first time.

So must have felt the first young, brown 
	paganAnd his pale, sweet mate,When he lay at her feet as she wove 
	mats of grasses,And he bound the little sandal upon
	her white foot - Then all their world woke to music;

And when she lifted her flower-face, 
And his rough lips discovered her 
	sweetness,The song of his wild heart arose 
And blendedWith the music of gods on their hills.

My lover, you come with garlands of 
	grasses,And deep-purple iris to crown me;You come with the tune of the soft-
	calling brook in the meadow;And woo me - your wooing is music;

And the low-singing note of Creation 
Blends with the song of your high pas-
	sion,Until the beauty and wonder of Life 
	overwhelms me,And I bow down and cover my face 
	in the grasses,And then - Shy, white little Spirits surround me 
	and sing to me.
