LUDLOW

War, do you want?Well, here's a war for you; 
Newest of clashes in oldest of strife; 
War of the lowly,
Justice their rally call, 
Ranked under banners century-stained.

Hands with the grimeOf the levels ground into them,Hands that wrest riches and then let them slip,Blunted hands, gnarled,Grubbing at humble toil,Clutch in extremity weapons of death.

Here we find men - Men who've got guts to them;Men who will fight at the end of the lane;Hot blood is raging,Hot blood of wronged men,Blood that will wash off the stain from the land.
