BUSINESS

I labor for my own ideal: 
The never ending bet-on-bet; 
I bind each separate wound I feel, 
Since I must think and act and get. 
For what withal? For power, fame 
Or riches? - I can scarcely know; 
And yet, years since the Vision came 
And stayed. I cannot let it go.
 A race-horse bred, whose nostrils sting, 
Waiting the starter's pistoled hand, 
My nerves leap forth to reach the string, 
The first before the judges'-stand. 
To win! What other thing can seem, 
In any sort of cause, sublime? 
You poet-painters have your Dream
 And Sacrifice - and I have mine.
