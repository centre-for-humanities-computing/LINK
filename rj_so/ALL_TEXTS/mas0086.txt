A HOUSE WITH GREEN BLINDS

I want a white house with green blinds
And a roof all painted red, 
With alder trees to shade it, 
And the blue sky overhead.

And all about the level lawns, 
With a flagged walk to the gate, 
Where iron spears have found their roots, 
In peace instead of hate.

And the long tree-shadowed street, 
Of some old-fashioned place, 
Where maids in flowered dimities 
Their blithe, light footsteps trace.


And where in long June twilights, 
The lovers meet and pass, 
And evening brings the scent of flowers,
And fresh smell of the grass.
 
I never knew a house like this, 
But I can see it plain, -  
Some homesick girl of long ago 
Must live in me again.
