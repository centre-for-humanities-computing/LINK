RESURRECTION

I hope there is a resurrection day,
For bodies, as the ancient prophets say, 
When Helen's naked limbs again will gleam 
Regathered from the dust of death's long dream, -  
When those who thrilled the ages, being fair, 
Will take the singing angels unaware 
And make God's perfect meadows doubly sweet 
With rosy vagrancy of little feet.
