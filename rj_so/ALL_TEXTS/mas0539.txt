A PORTRAIT

Day by day she grows in upon herself,
Day by day more aloof, more fastidiously with-
	drawn,
Further from life; like Buddha she grows inward, 
Save that her growing is not toward infinite immen-
	sities,
But toward infinitesimal finesses. 
Fragile as a filigree of porcelain
And as delicately designed for no hard uses; 
Alone through many years, ageing into a fine parch-
	ment beauty, 
She has cut off from herself all the struggle, 
She has shut out from her all the hard sweetness of 
	life.
Dining with her that night the talk was intelligent,
Quick and showing a wide range of interest -  
But under it all, the strained guard against unpleas-
	antness,
The wary light fleet thought, veering away
From all that burns, all that throbs, all that lives,
All that urges and pants and sings.
Day by day she grows in upon herself,
Day by day more aloof, more fastidiously withdrawn.
