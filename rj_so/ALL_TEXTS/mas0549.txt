MNEMONIAN WIND

The wind in the Metropolitan tower 
	Has a stark note of tragedy unappeased, 
And a loneliness that eats into the heart.
	It is not a city wind. 
It is the wind that blows in old farmhouses 
Where women have worked as slaves and have gone mad. 
I have heard it shriek so down the chimney 
In the close parlor at country funerals.
	A wind of ghosts and regrets.
