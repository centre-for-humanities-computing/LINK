WEARINESS

Love - Let me climb up in your eyes 
And nestle there,In your soft brown eyes,In your man-kind eyes,Let me come and nestle there,And sleep, deep,Like a mother's tiny child 
Inert with weariness.Let me creep up in your eyes 
And slumber there 
Till the little brown birds 
And the dawnCome tippering around our house.
