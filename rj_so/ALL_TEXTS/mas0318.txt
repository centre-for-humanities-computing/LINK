THE LITTLE UGLY DUCKLING

Narcissus bulbs -   
Little brown things. 
I traded my luncheon for you. 
Bought you from a suave Jap 
In a Nippon garden. 
For seven days 
I have tended you anxiously. 
Yet you still remain, small and shabby. 
Will I regret my tears of pity shed 
	for you? 
Or will you yet fool me
And bloom star-like 
From your cracked saucer?
