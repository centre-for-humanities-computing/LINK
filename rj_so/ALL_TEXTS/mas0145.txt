BUTTONS

I have been watching the war map slammed up for 
advertising in front of the newspaper office.
Buttons  - red and yellow buttons - blue and black but-
	tons - are shoved back and forth across the map.

A laughing young man, sunny with freckles,
Climbs a ladder, yells a joke to somebody in the crowd,
And then fixes a yellow button one inch west
And follows the yellow button with a black button one 
	inch west.

(Ten thousand men and boys twist on their bodies in
	 a red soak along a river edge,
Gasping of wounds, calling for water, some rattling 
	death in their throats.)
Who by Christ would guess what it cost to move two 
	buttons one inch on the war map here in front of 
	the newspaper office where the freckle-faced young
	 man is laughing to us?
