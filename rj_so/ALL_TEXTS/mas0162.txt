A MANHATTAN YARD

My small room opens on a city yard	Where never a space for Spring's dance can there be 
For the cold, huddled stones with faces hard 
	Heed not at all the gray Wind's minstrelsy.

And yet - when darkness falls, I feel out there	Most certainly an orchard's murmuring 
As though small buds in rain-washed April air,	Were lifting up their heads to smell of Spring.

Perchance long years ago in this bare place 
	An old Dutch garden grew in grave delight.And now pale buds and flowers with phantom face 
	Slip back to dream away the wistful night.
