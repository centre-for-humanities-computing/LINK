MORNING-AFTER THOUGHT

Me! Me! I shrieked . . .
Flaunting the red ribbon of my personality,
Before his kind, bewildered eyes. . . 
When he stood alone in quiet places
I sought him out and dragged him to the light - 
All the while talking loud, above the revelers' shouts.

"See - see - am I not flamboyant . . .
Aren't my little comments nice and clever - 
Can't I turn a phrase brilliantly . . .
And please regard my bold, challenging person . . .

Me! Me! Me! I shrieked. . . 
How could he know - 
That it was only a slim, wistful voice in me 
Crying out for a quiet moment of understanding - 
Groping humbly for a bit of contact with what 
	seemed to be the fulness of his soul. . .
