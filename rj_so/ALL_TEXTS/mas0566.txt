"EXTRA"

Here it is quiet: 
The soft lamplight falls 
Upon piled cushions and pale-tinted 
	walls
And long low shelves. 
Tulips aglow
Trumpet their golden beauty on the air, 
The most alive of all the loveliness 
The small room holds, 
The only living things, except for where 
One stands by the wide window, listen-
	ing.
Up from the dark streets the calm
	night-winds bear 
The gamins' shrilling roar. 
It splits the night Like guns.It wounds the silence with a shrapnel-
	shriek. 
It fades, like the noise of death, raucous
	and weak. 
Into the smiling rest of that still room 
Its dying ring 
Breaks,
And goes on, echoing, echoing, 
Echoing.
It sounds the unequal, slow, mono-
	tonous tread 
Of tired workers tramping to and fro 
Dun factories.
It sounds the thin small wail 
Of children vainly fretting to be fed. 
It sounds the turning of the iron keys. 
It sounds the whisper of women, won-
	dering
If certain shapes are men asleep or 
	dead.
It sounds the grunt and squeal of sud-
	den hurt,
And twisted bodies in the blood-stained 
	dirt.
It sounds the young impatient note 
Wrung from some Amazonian throat 
Crying for bread, 
And roses too.
Not from the street but from the world
	in torment 
The harsh cry is hurled, 
In whose muffled confusion lurks 
The fear that darkens love. 
We need
Promethean laughter; 
And the conquering fires 
Of unappeasable desires 
Are ours to feed. 
For yet will their divine insanities 
Quicken men's raptures and men's ago-
	nies.
