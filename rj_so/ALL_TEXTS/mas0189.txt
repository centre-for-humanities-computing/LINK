GARDENS OF BABYLON

Huddled chimneys grey, forlorn,
In the deadened light of a city morn. 
Roof tops ranging, red and high, 
Tenement windows glaring, dry. 
And - Flower pots! 
Gaily caparisoned flower pots!
 Nodding against the sky!

Fire escapes alive with the green 
Of scarlet runner and Indian bean, 
Caught in a handful of black dirt 
Carried home in a baby's skirt. 
Flower pots!
Verdantly growing flower pots! 
Lifting their blooms on high!

Jack and the Beanstalk's magic might -  
Vines spring up in a single night. 
Old faces soften, children stare 
At the slender gardens in the air. 
Flower pots!
Meagre little clay flower pots!
Bring the glow of the country there!
