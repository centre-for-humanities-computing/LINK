THE STRIKERS

You have made your shrouds, O Proud and 
	Great.Your graves are dug; they are deep as Hate. 
We toiled; our pay was Hunger and Pain. 
We begged; our portion was disdain. 
We asked for justice - you gave us jeers. 
We asked for pity‚Äîyou gave us sneers. 
Our starving babes are dear as your own: 
Their coffins are earth; their dirge a moan. . . . 
O Proud Oppressor: your shroud is here: 
Grimly, we weave it with wail and tear.
