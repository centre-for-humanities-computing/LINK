O IT'S A JOY TO SING WITH THE HAIR FLUNG FREE

O it's joy to sing with the hair flung free, 
And a thousand, thousand petals blowing from the tree; 
A thousand, thousand mad songs go racing thru my head, 
For the living can sing - but never the dead!

A thousand, thousand petals may fall on the stone,
Where the lovely dead lady is lying alone;
But she will not sing in the cool spring air,
Nor catch the falling petals, nor fling out her hair.
