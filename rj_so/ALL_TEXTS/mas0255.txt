THE FOOD RIOTS

With wealth of the autumn
		the fruit trees were heavy - 
	With burden of red and with burden
		 of gold;The vines of the vineyard were strong 
		in their bearing, 
	The olive-trees faithful, the apple-
		trees bold; 
The wide fields were brave with the 
		ripe yellow grain, 
	From the coast to the coast, North		and South, far and wide, 
	And great was the harvest to nour-
		ish our pride, 
Heaped high in the barns, filling train 
		after train.		But women are crying,			"Give food or we die - 
		The markets are full			But the poor cannot buy - 
		Give milk for our babies			And meat for our men 
		And bread that our bodies			May labor again!"

The cattle have bred and the flocks		are increasing, 
	The fowl have sent fledglings abroad		in the air; 
The fish come in schools to the shores		of the ocean 
Or leap in white streams for the people		to share.The valleys are rich and the groves on 
		the hills,	Oh, fat is the land, East and West,		far and wide, 
	And fair are the prairies and great		is our pride 
In the bounty that quickens, the beauty		that thrills.

		But poor is the people			Whose women must cry, 
		"We work, but we starve - 			Give us food or we die! 
		Give milk for our babies			And meat for our men 
		And bread that our bodies			May labor again!"
