THE PROFESSORS

Strange, shoddy men play chess 
	with words up there 
Upon the Hill, and think their 
	game is life. 
They think their little squared-off
	board reflects 
Upon its white and black, the aspir-
	ations
And passions of the world. They
	think they've found 
In their poor dusty studies, patterns
	for men
To live by. And they cannot under-
	stand
Youth's strange irreverence and won-
	dering. 
Sometime they'll die,
And never having lived, they'll go to 
	heaven
And play with words eternally.
