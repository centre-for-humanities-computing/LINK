I am hungry, 
I have fed my body on beefsteak, 
Camembert and brussels sprouts; 
My mind on books, 
Plays and argument;
My emotions on love, anger and sorrow. 
But my psychic self is starved.
I hear it hollering for a good meal 
Of fourth dimensional food. 
Something more than victuals for 
Body, mind and soul 
I crave.
I should like to take a big bite 
Out of the red-cheeked cosmos.
