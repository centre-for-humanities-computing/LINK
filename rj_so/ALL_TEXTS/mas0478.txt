GREEN SEAS

On some green hillside do I dwell where the 
	green sea is very near, 
So in the day or in the night the moving waters I 
	may hear;
And every grove of liveoak is an echo underneath 
	the breeze
Of the unceasing restlessness of those dim, scented, 
	ancient seas.

The plains call to the tranquil ones, the hills hold
	poets to their breasts; 
The forests speak to those who know, and in the
	lake the stranger rests; 
But the green hillside I have known is not itself
	beloved of me -  
Only it is the couch from which I watch the green
	and changing sea.
