THE NAME

My heart hath heard thy step afar
	For all its lightness, 
Though the wet grass 'neath thy foot 
	Hath not lost its whiteness;

And I know, the while thy lips
	Have not confessed it, 
All the sweetness of thy name - 
	My heart hath guessed it.

By the light about thy face,
	Thou art called Morning.
 By the white flower in thy hand,
	Thou art called April.
