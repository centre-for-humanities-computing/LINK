UNFORGIVING

"Mother's love redeems," they say,	Bearers of a message sweet, 
Come to woo her from the way	Sin has led her wanton feet; 
But no echo, tender, true,	Wakes the past, with joy elate; 
Mother's love she never knew - 	She whose heart knows mother-hate!

Mother's love! Her scorn of men	Flames less fiercely than her wrath 
For the wrongs she suffered then	In the days that shaped her path; 
Winsome voices weave no spell	When they name the one of all 
Who was heedless when she fell,	Who condemned her to her fall.

Mother's love! No haunting note	Of its music brings her thrill; 
In its stead dark passions gloat,	Demons grim that work their will; 
Monsters that from impulse grew,	Once her foibles, now her fate: 
Mother's love she never knew - 	She whose heart knows mother-hate!

Mother's love! Could love beget	Shame and all her sorry breed -  
Endless ache and wild regret,	Hope, a waste, and life, a weed?
Kind persuaders lose their spell	When they name the one of all 
Who was heedless when she fell.	Who condemned her to her fall.

Yet, ah! yet her brightest dream	Mirrors this that she has missed, 
When her babe's fond glances beam	Love on lips his own have kissed -  
Blessed fancy! tender, true,	Heaven's boon to hapless fate; 
Mother's love she never knew - 	She whose heart knows mother-hate!
