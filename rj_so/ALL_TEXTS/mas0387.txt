A DUNE SONNET

I was so lonely on the dunes to-day;	The shadow of a bird passed o'er the sand, 
And I, a driftwood relic in my hand. . .  Sea winds are not more lonely when they strayA little fitful and bewildered way	In this wan acre, whose dry billows stand 
	So pitilessly still of curve, so bland,And wide, and waiting, infinitely grey.

In hollows I could almost hear them say, 
The misty breezes - Run, we will not stay	In this unreal and spiritual land!	Our soul of life is calling from the strand, 
Whose blue and breathing bosom leapt, or lay, 
Or laughed to us in shots of silver spray!
