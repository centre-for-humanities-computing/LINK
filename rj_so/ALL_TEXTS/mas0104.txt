NAMES

The price of milk went up one cent,
A penny more a quart,
And a rich man made through the summer months 
Five thousand more than he ort.
He made five thousand more a year,
And they called him a "wonderful financier"
The babes in the slums went up to God - 
5,000! It, startled the nation
The Charities puzzled, they wondered 
	why,
And began an investigation 
Of what caused the babies to wither 
	and faint - 
And they called the cause "the summer 
	complaint."

Then the rich man gave 500 bucks,
500 bucks he gave,
To relieve the scourge of summer complaint,
And the babies' lives to save.
With 500 bucks he headed the list,
And they called him a "great philan-
	tropist."
