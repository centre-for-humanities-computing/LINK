WAR CHANGES

IT isn't that they have loosed a red wind of hate upon us, 
	Nor the blood they've spilt;
But that we must weave the threads of life into a tassel 
To deck a sabre hilt.

It isn't that they have killed our young men in their wooing time, 
	Nor what their trumpet saith;
But that their cannons blow away our dreams of brotherhood 
	And wound our faith.

It isn't that they have made so many kings and cabinets 
	Exhaust their treasuries of lies;
But that they have put boasting in the mouths of boys we drink 
	beer with -
And bayonets in their eyes.

It isn't that their shells have battered down so many ancient shrines 
	And changed the old world's face;
But that they have made the little fenced-in yard behind the house
	A very different place
