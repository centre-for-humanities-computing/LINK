TO THE FLOWERS AT CHURCH

Soft little daughters of the mead,The random bush, the wanton weed, 
That lived to love, and loved to breed,	Who hither bound you? 
I see you're innocent of all the screed	That bellows around you.

Ye laughing daffodilies yellow 
Beneath a bendy pussy-willow, 
I fail to see you gulp and swallow	The Apostles' Creed, 
Or shudder at the fates that follow	Adam's deed.

Big bloody hymns the choir sings 
And blows it to the "King of Kings," 
The while ye dream of humble things	That wander there 
Where first ye spread your golden wings	On summer air - 

Like Jesus, simple and divine, 
In beauty not in raiment fine, 
Who asked no high or holier shrine	In which to pray 
Than garden groves of Palestine,	'Neath olives gray.

His name, I think, would still be bright, 
Tho' churches were forgotten quite, 
And they with aspirations right,	Should simple be, 
And lift their heads into the light	As straight as ye.
