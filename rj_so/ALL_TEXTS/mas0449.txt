SONG OF THE FREE POET

It'll be a devil in my verse - 
	I'll talk about the boldest things! 
I'll sing of bums and thieves and worse, 
	In fierce and vivid canticlings;
		I'll speak of whores in all the stanzas 
		Of my brave, up-to-date romanzas!

I'll rave at God and at the Church, 
	I'll curse my parents and the flag; 
And never end my desperate search
	For wicked words that snarl and snag; 
		I'll paint a world where only lust is, 
		And spit upon the courts of justice!

I'll stand in lonely fellowship
	With Self - the only god that wins! 
In words, at least, I will not skip 
	One of the red forbidden sins; 
		But in my life no sin I'll feature; 
		I'll be as proper as a preacher!
