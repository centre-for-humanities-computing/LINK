WIND AND FLAME

Press with rude joy upon the world, 
	Persistent Flow, resistless Spark; 
Scatter your blows and torches, hurled 
	With bright creation through the dark.

Leap, Wind - with such a rapture come, 
	With such a clean and rushing breath,
That cries will burst from lips long dumb, 
	Rousing the stagnant hosts from death.

Laugh, Flame, gay offspring of the sun, 
	Whose heat is at the roots of birth;
Burn, till the dry and dead things run 
	And blaze upon the blossoming earth.

Mingle your quickening powers; contend, 
	Ye two great Lovers, in your love;
Struggling to give all in the end, 
	And giving all - yet not enough. . . 

Till, springing from that passionate strife,
	Men are reborn through ecstasy -  
The flame that burns the world to life;
	The wind that leaps to set it free!
