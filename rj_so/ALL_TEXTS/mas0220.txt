THE SONG OF THE STREET

The song of the street comes up to my 
		ears:	A wail - then the patter of little feet 
From the mines and the mills and the	pavements below,
Beating the time for the Song of the	Street.

Then the voices of women, half-clothed 
		and half starved, 
	Crying aloud "For raiment and meat 
Ourselves and our children are offered 
		for sale" - 
These are the zvords for the Song of 
		the Street.

The voices of men whose spirits are 
		crushed,	Calling in anguish for death to com-
		pleteThe murder that Life has so badly 
		begun - 	This is the tune for the Song of the 
		Street.

A moan in the darkness - a cry in the 
		night	And curses that rise to God's glorious 
		seat;A prayer to the sound of sobs stifled 
		in vain - 	Thus do they echo the Song of the 
		Street.
