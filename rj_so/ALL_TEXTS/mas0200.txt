THE BARBER SHOP

I spend my life in a warren of worried men.
In and out and to and fro 
And up and down in electric elevators 
They rush about and speak each other, 
Hurrying on to finish the deal, 
Hurrying home to wash and eat and sleep, 
Hurrying to love a little maybe 
Between the dark and dawn 
Or cuddle a tired child 
Who blinks to see his father.

I hurry too but with a sense 
That Life is hurrying faster 
And will catch up with me.

Right in the middle of our furious activity 
Two soft-voiced barbers in a little room. 
White-tiled and fresh and smelling cldiciously. 
Flourish their shimmering tools 
And smile and barb
And talk,about the war and stocks and the Hono-
	lulu earthquake 
With equa'r^mpartiahty.

I like to go there. 
Time seems slow and patient 
While they tuck me up in white 
And hover over me.
The room gives north and west and the sunset sky 
Lights the gray river to a ribbon of glory 
Where silhouetted tugs
Like tooting beetles fuss about their smoky busi-
	nesses.

Besides, in that high place 
No curious passer-by
Can see my ignominious bald spot treated with a 
	tonic,
Nor can a lady stop and bow to me, my chin in lather 
As happened once. 
So I go there often 
And even take a book.

There's another person, all in white,
Who comes and goes and manicures your nails
On application.
One can read with one hand while she does the other.
Because I felt that Life was hurrying me along
With horrid haste
Soon to desert me utterly,
I used to take my Inferno in my pocket
And reflect on what might happen
Were I among the usurers.

One day a low-pitched voice broke in.
I listened vaguely,
What was the woman saying?
"Please listen for a moment, Mister Brown,
I've done your nails for almost half a year
You've never looked at me."

I looked at that,
And sure enough the girl was young and round and 
	sweet.
She colored as I turned to her,
And looked away.
I waited, silent, enjoying her confusion.
The words had been shot out at me
And now apparently she wished them back.
"What do you want?" I said.
Again a silence while she rubbed away.
I picked up my Inferno with an ironic thought
Towards Paradiso waiting on the shelf,
"Well, rub away, my girl,
You opened up, go on."

The book provoked her -
"I'm straight," she said,
I never talked like this before,
The fellows that come round - 
Well, I can't stand 'em,
The things they say!
The shows they take me to!
You're different, I want to know
What's in that book you read
I want to hear you talk - 
Oh, Mister, I'm so lonesome
But I'm straight, I tell you,
I read too every evening in my room
But I can't ever find
The books you have,
I expect you think I'm horrid
To talk like this - but
I got some things by an Englishman
From the Public Library,
Say, they were queer!
He thinks a woman has a right
To say out if she loves a man,
He thinks they do the looking
Because they want - 
Oh, Mister, I'm so terribly ashamed
I'll die when I get home,
An' yet I had to speak - 
I'd be awful, awful good to you, if only - 
Please, please, don't think I'm like - 
Don't think I'm one o' them!
Whatever you say, don't, don't think that!

She stopped, and turned to hide her crying.
I looked at her again,
Looked at her young wet eyes,
At her abashed bent head,
Looked at her sweet, deft hands
Busy with mine. . . .

But - 
Not for nothing
Were my grandfather and four of my uncles
Elders in the Sixth Presbyterian Church 
Situated on the Avenue -  
Oh, not for nothing 
Was I led 
To squirm on those green rep seats 
One day in seven - 

And now
The white-tiled, sweetly-smelling barber shop 
Is lost to me, 
What a pity!
