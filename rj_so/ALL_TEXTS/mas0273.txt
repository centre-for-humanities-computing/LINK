THE SECOND COMING

And when (so runs the tale) the Christ 
	had ceased 
A Rich Man rose and Hawed and 
	cleared his throat, 
And said he had arisen from a feast 
	That he might come and Sound a 
		Warning Note. 
"This crank," he said, "would take from 
	us the thing 
That holds society to-day in tether; 
He would make every shirking lout a 
	kingAnd crush the honest toiler altogether. 
Think of those words of his - that	blackest blasphemy; 
He said, 'Leave Private Property and	follow me!'"

And rose the Statesman: "Fe-e-ellow 
	citizens,At such an hour no patriot should
	missThe chance to try to thousands or to 
	tens,'Alas! that our fa-a-a-air land should 
	come to this!' 
Why, friends, he claims the laws our 
	fathers passed - Our hallowed prisons and reforma-
	tories - Our whipping posts - our sacred guns 
	new-cast -  
Might be abolished (see his 
	allegories).'Think of it, fellow citizens, this rascal 
	robsA million honest toilers of their lawful 
	jobs!"

"Yea," cried the Priest, "this blatant 
	demagogue, 
This home-destroyer - greedier then 
	fireThis lying, filthy, anarchistic dog,Attacks religion, vilifies the spire 
That we haze lately raised at such ex-
	pense,And calls our House of God unnecessary;Curses our profitable tenements, 
And says we think toe much of Little 
	Mary!How long, 0 God, shall this traducer	shame thy day? 
Away with him!" Answered they all:	"Away! Away!"

And quick and sure as shuttles in the 
	weaves,They staked his all among them as	they diced; 
And, having spoiled him, lo! between	two thieves,
 Again they crucified the living Christ.
