THE STAR-BEES

The stars are golden bees, 
Booming through the sky-meadows;
As they fly, they utter a sweet humming noise, 
That rings with melody through the wide Heavens. 
Sometimes, when my ears are closed, 
I can almost catch that far humming.

We see them such a tiny time! 
All that we call hours, years, centuries, 
They, flashing in their golden speed, 
Seem to have hardly moved;
One swift glimpse, and our eyes are closed forever. 
Oh, the vast meadows they fly through,
Sky staked out next to sky; 
And oh, the strange sweet flowers they visit, 
Burrowing deep into the cloven blossom-hearts for the 
	honey.

At night the bees go back to the hive; 
But it is dawn to them now, 
And they scatter in the sky-meadows. 
To us the wild splendor of their flaming dawn - is dark-
	ness.

At evening they will fly home to the hive.
Can we guess that black final night?
