RAIN

Rain, rain, murmuring endless complaints 
	In mournful whisperings which never cease, 
	You bring my tired brain a certain peace
Like Latin prayers to absent-minded saints:

And whether silently to earth you fall,
	Or dashed and driven in tempestuous flight,
	Like souls before God's wrath, the thirsty night,
The soft and fecund earth shall drink you all.
