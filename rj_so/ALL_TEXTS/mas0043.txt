THEM AND THEIR WIVES

Their pictures are all in the papers, 
	The Emperors, War Lords and Czars -  
The proud, the august, the world-shapers -  
	Bedecked with their garters and stars; 
Bedecked with their stars and their garters	(Which they wear every day of their lives)
And with all their sons and their darters,	And - what takes my attention - their wives, 
			Wives; 
		Pious and dutiful, 
		Mostly unbeautiful, 
		Kirching. and kindering wives; 
		Prim, beatific, 
		Prudent, prolific, 
		Firm anti-suffragist wives;
		 Most exemplary good wives. 
Though some have their lords slightly bested	In the matter of inches, 'tis true, 
Or one with good looks be invested,	Or one be accounted a shrew, 
Yet you can discern in their faces,	(You've noticed it all of your lives) 
The homespun, convenient graces	That monarchs are blessed with in wives, 
			Wives;		
		The bovine, bourgeois graces, 
		Sort of good-squaw graces 
Kingly ones have in their wives.
