CASABIANCA 

The boy stood on the burning deck;
	You've heard of him before; 
He did not reason, did not reck,
	Amid the battle's roar.

Both foolishly and dull, he stood,
	His face all wan and wild, 
Yet fable makes him calm and good,
	This poor, misguided child.

The flames rolled on - he might have guessed,
	Had he had half a brain,
His father, dear, had gone to rest,
	Was either burned or slain.

But, e'en had daddy been alive, 
	This child's weak, plaintive bleat,
'Mid cannon's din, would reach nor five, 
	Nor six, nor seven feet.

And yet he stood and called his sire,
	With eloquent appeal, 
Meanwhile the ship was all afire,
	From mizzen-mast to keel.

And this is he, whose tragic fate
	 Is trimmed with halo bright
To walk our little children straight 
	And keep them sitting tight.

But stay, be not harsh with this lad,
	 Who stood there all alone.
Suppose he'd disobeyed his dad, 
	Where would he, pray, have gone?

He stood, remember, on a deck,
	Whence all, they say, had fled, 
But fleeing from a burning deck
	Is harder done than said.

This may console each goodly man 
	Who would this child admire
.He did not like the frying-pan, 
	So perished in the fire.

View as of old this val'rous verse 
	Or reconstruct your notion,
The burning deck is not much worse 
	Than drowning in the ocean.
