SONGS OF PROTEST

Underneath the muck of things, 
	Underneath the whole world's blot,Something, they tell us, always sings -  
	Why do we hear it not?

In the heart of things unclean, 
	Somewhere in the furious fight,God's face can be clearly seen - 
	What has destroyed our sight?

Yet have we seen enough to feel, 
	Yet have we heard enough to knowWho bound us to the awful wheel -  
	Whose hands have brought us low. . . .

And we shall cry out till the wind 
	Roars in their ears the thing to come - Aye, though they made us deaf and blind 
	God could not keep us dumb!
