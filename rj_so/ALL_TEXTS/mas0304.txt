THE DREAM

Is it not strange that in this costly silk,
As exquisite as a flower, I should be sad? 
Upon my breast is lace like moonlit haze 
Of blossoms. See! the folds as white as milk 
Across my shoulders, and my gems ablaze. 
Yet never has this splendor made me glad.

Last night I dreamed. . . . And now I know. . . .
	They came, - 
A ghostly crowd of girls with eyes too bright 
And wistful - Ah! I could not hide my tears!
 One child, as vivid as a slender flame,
Was fashioning June roses with her shears. 
Their crimson petals left her young lips white.

Another little one with hands as pale
As the soft, misty lace her touch caressed.
Wove all her star like loves and fantasies
Into its web until its beauty frail
Was part of her; but yet, - with aged knees
This little one crept homeward dimly drest.

Ah God! A third with hair as bright as corn, 
Who flashed her slender needle in a dream. 
Looked up at me. Her eyes were dark with pain. 
Then I awoke and it was sunny morn - 
But in the dawn there was for me no gleam,
- And I can never wear the dress again.
