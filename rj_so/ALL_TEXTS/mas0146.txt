TO THE SUICIDES 

Unhallowed Ones;
Your vice was Impatience:
You might have done better 
Had you waited for War.

Then Kings had praised you,
Bishops had blessed you,
Calling you holy - 
Women had knitted for you 
Mittens and socks,
Holding the needles and yarn cutely 
On their Laps 
In the Theatre 
Between the Acts - 
Poets had sung of you
Calling your dying heroic.
Civilization - poor hussy - had wept for you 
Out of her Million Eyes - 
Bankers and Gamblers,
Profiteers and Dealers in powder,
Students and Doctors and Dustmen - 
All, all had wept for you,
Sniffling, Blubbering, Culture and Duty - 
Calling you Saviors.

Unhallowed Ones,
Your Vice was impatience.
