THE INCENTIVE

I saw a sickly cellar plant
Droop on its feeble stem for want
	Of sun and wind and rain and dew -  
	Of freedom ; then a man came through 
	The cellar, and I heard him say, 
	"Stay, foolish plant, by all means stay 
	Contented here : for know you not 
	This stagnant dampness, mould and rot 
	Are your incentive to grow tall 
	And reach that sunbeam on the wall." 
	Even as he spoke, the sun's one spark 
	Withdrew, and left the dusk more dark.
