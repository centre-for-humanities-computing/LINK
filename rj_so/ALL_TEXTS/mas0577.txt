SEA MOTHS

And there were anemones . . . 
Bound with, green sea-weed, 
Delicate clouds of loveliness. 
Swaying with the sinuous waves 
	Of the turning tide. 
And in thte tiny salt pools -                 
Kisses left for the grey rocks -  
Lay languorous starfish  
And lavender snails, 
Clinging fast to the thrift. 
. . . . . And all these are for the sea's  
	delight. 
And she soon with eager wooing, 
Will hold these fragile miracles 
Close to her breasts. 
. . . . . The waves . . . 
The dancing girls of the sea, 
Laughing and throwing high 
Their slim white arms,                
Run and play √≥n the yellow beach.  
	Their music is the throbbing tones 
Of frail sea-shells, 
Which pour forth unceasingly 
Magical songs of mystery.   
. . . . . See! the gulls, their lovers, 
Lured on to madness  
Swerve in passionate haste 
To kiss their pale wan cheeks.
