TO AN ARTIST ON HIS BIRTHDAY

On this day that belongs to you, 
My heart belongs to you also, 
And the hearts of all your friends. 
To you who have given much, 
TodayWe too give something. 
Our gift may not be heavy upon your 
	palms,You may not feel its weight, - Our thinking of you - But sometimeWhen you are a little lonelyAnd when your fingers pressThe dry tube of joy,And no color flows from it,ThenYou may find the giftAnd cut the stringAnd lift it from its wrappings,This gift that we bring today- Our thinking of you.
