MIGHTY FIRES

O THESE bear the gift of life 
Like a singing fire, 
Like a shining wind! 
O THESE swing the sledge of life 
With a mighty roar! 
With . . . a . . . mighty . . , roar!

There's Geraldine, 
Giving us Joan of France 
In the flesh and blood.

If human courage had never been, 
And human faith had never lived, 
She would have created them, 
Every day, 
Fullblown, 
Suddenly monumental, 
And as glad as a thousand glittering 						banners,
Waving - Waving - Waving - Waving -  
Waving - Waving!

There's Carl Sandburg 
Singing and building out of the glori-
	ous blood of everyday men, 
And you and me, 
And sweat,
And sky-scrapers of steel,
 And Chicago, -  
Making us fond of life again. 
Not Milton, 
Or William of Avon, 
Or, august translated Virgil, 
But oh! Singing of MY generation! 
Of ME!
MY Carl Sandburg! 

There's Isadora,
Giving us back our happy bodies, 
Showing us how beautiful we are: 
Dancing for us
Till our ancient, awkward, hooded 
modesty
Would cry for joy!

THESE bear the gift of life
Like a singing fire,
Like a shining wind! 
These swing the sledge of life
With a mighty roar,
With . . . a . . . mighty . . . roar!

Ah THESE are my Christs! And
	many more! 
And yet, some days,
Even a sparrow in the eaves 
Can save my soul.
