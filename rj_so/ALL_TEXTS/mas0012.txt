EIGHTH HEAVEN

'Tis said that there are places seven, 
	For all good people when they die, 
And far beyond there's another Heaven,
	 For the man who never told a he.And there he sits, alone, alone;	No one to cuss him or wish him well, 
And day and night he makes this moan,	"Oh Lord, I wish I'd gone to Hell."
