HER VEINS ARE LIT WITH STRANGE DESIRE

Her veins are lit with strange desire, 
	A force of earth, but more than earth; 
The burst of spring, the summer's fire, 
	Is in her mirth.

A mad, wild essence is her blood,
	She hears the storm when winds are still,
And all the rushing torrent flood
	Is in her will.

Quenched fires, stopped flood, defeated spring.
	Desire stone-dead within the mould,
And love that brought you everything - 
	Has left her cold.
