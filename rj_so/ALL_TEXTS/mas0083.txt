THE ONE WISH

Oh that you could walk the world in a visible flame;
The flame of my love! 
People would turn to you - thrilled by this wonder; 
But who would dare claim or touch you? 
Men and women would draw back as you passed in 
	your shining and terrible garment.

That fire would burn away the mists of Spring 
And shed a great light over the hills. 
Wrapped in that tender armor, 
Shielded by that valiant halo,
You would run the highroads of the world with a clear 
	gaze - 

You would look into all eyes and your own soul with
	courage and laghter. . . . 
And into mine with ecstasy and understanding.
