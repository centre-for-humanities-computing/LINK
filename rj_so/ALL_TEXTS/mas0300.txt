THE HUMORIST

He was a perfect Cheshire Cat of a man -
With grin inextinguishable. 
His every ready prank and joke and explosive laughter 
Welcomed him to every bar room clique.
Even now,
Though for a breath 
His moon face slumped,
As he glimpsed the corpse in its black casket 
At last peaceful in the candles yellow flicker, 
The next his face glowed again.

He turned to the earth-worn widow 
With babe crushed to her breast. 
"Jim's had his last souse, lady,"
 He smiled at the humor of it.

The woman's dull stare wavered 
An instant -
Then returned again to the coming hollow years.
