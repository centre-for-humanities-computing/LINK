TO CONGRESS CONCERNING THE BILL FOR UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE

Ignorant tyrants, reckless and uncouth, 
Mad with the fury that foretells your end, 
Soldiers and lawmakers and fools, attend 
For once the unfamiliar voice of truth. 
You force a sword into the hand of Youth, 
Foredooming him to battle, you pretend 
That weapons and that threats of war defend 
The cause of peace, - as Europe shows, forsooth!

Beware, the loud injustice of your plan 
Sets vibrant the long-silent tocsin bell, 
And consecrated treason walks abroad, 
Betraying nations for the cause of Man, -  
When nations with their strife go down to hell 
Mankind as one shall see the face of God.
