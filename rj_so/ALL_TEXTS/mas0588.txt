THE FAMILY PEW

Life came to me 
As light comes through a window 
	of stained glass, 
Purple and brown. 
I always saw the people stationary, 
Made up of neatly fitted bits of glass
	of blue and red, 
Flat - faced, square - jointed, surface-
	smooth,
I saw them silent, changeless, hard, 
I, as silent and as surface-smooth as 
	they,
Indoors where I was placed,
I sitting in adulterated light through
	them. 
Then suddenly I heard far of 
A singing wind,
In waving branches and in sails at sea,
A little sleepy tune at first,
It grew and neared,
It caught and thralled me
Like the mad skirl of pipes,
And passed.
I leaped and bounded out
And found the world.
Over a green clover meadow bloomed 
	a white pear orchard in the dazzling 
	light of spring,
In a wood two bullocks fought,
In a field a man followed in the slow 
	furrow of his plough,
A yellow oriole sang upon the sway-
	ing branch of an old elm,
And I,
I ran and shouted in the white light 
	of life.
