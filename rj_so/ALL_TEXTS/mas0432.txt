SPIRIT ROADS

There are trails that wind in under 
Enchanted vines and trees, 
That are paths that walk our wonder 
Over seven hundred seas; 
There are trails along the streamers 
Of the moon and stars and sun, 
But they never call to dreamers 
Who have the legs to run.

The ways of iridescence 
That set desire aflame 
With a purple incandescence 
That casts the shadow of shame 
Are pressed with pathways beaten 
By Virtue's phantom heels 
That travel there to sweeten 
The fragrance of ideals.

The fiery paths of trouble 
That are gauntlets of the soul, 
That rise and fall and double, 
May sometimes reach a goal, 
But having found fulfilment, 
Dim and fade along the past, 
Leaving those of unfulfilment 
To lure and grip and last.

And the road whose lure is strongest, 
Whose tracks are perfume-sweet, 
The road that lingers longest 
Is the path where little feet 
Have pattered through a doorway 
And out across a lawn 
Where there wasn't any doorway
And there wasn't any lawn.
