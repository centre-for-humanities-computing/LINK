"NIGGER TILLY"

The best cook
And the slickest thief 
In the state of Texas.
She would have stolen the golden candle-sticks
From the very throne of God,
To light the way for one she loved - 
And she loved me.
That was Tilly's code.

Generous, insane, romantic,
An ape even to copying the jerking limp of her mistress, 
A slave where she loved, 
A viper where she hated -  
That was Tilly's character.

An ashy face greased with bacon rind, 
A ragged scar on her left cheek -  
From lip to ear, 
Where
One raging Othello
Had nearly loved her to death.
Fat breasts, uncorseted, 
That hammocked my head to sleep.
Long gorilla arms that reached me
No matter where I hid.
A heart so big it made me wonder 
That one skin could house so much of goodness -  
That was Tilly!

A dead shot with a rock - 
I have seen her toss a pebble 
And end the merry-making of a fly; 
I have seen her hurl a stone
And pick off my neighbor's fan-tail pigeon. . . .

			ON THE DEATH OF THE FAMILY HORSE
"Pore old Clebeland -  
	Dar he lay,
		An' his sperret ain't to trubble
			Till de jedgement day, 
		But he carcass guine be meltin'
			Widout no hope - 
		Into yaller wropped packages 
			Of soap, soap, soap!"

			TILLY'S APOLOGY
"I's down-right bad, Miss Rosie
,But the"good Gawd know'd I'd be, 
When he gone squanderin' pashion 
Like he done done in me!

She raised us all
Then hung about without any usefulness,
A dark, expected spot on the landscape,
Something with its roots driven deep into the memory
	of things - 
Ignored
Like a weather-beaten hitching-post
After the family is driving a six-cylinder. 
One day there was a new look in her eye -  
The white shot with red, 
The black stretched and greedy.
She threaded the handle of her dish pan with a ribband 
And marching 'round and 'round the house 
Thundered upon the tin with an iron bar 
Chanting: - 
		"My poker am my -fife, 
		An' my pan am my drum; 
		Gawd damn de niggers -  
		An' a bum! bum!! bum!!!

They came - those officers - 
And chased Nigger Tilly;
Ten million years back she went,
Clawing her way up into an acorn tree,
And there on a branch she chittered and jibbered,
		"My poker am my -life,
		An' my pan am my drum;
		Gawd damn de niggersâ€š - 
		An a bum! bum!! bum!!!

Down she fell 
And lumped
Like the sack of carrots in the cellar.
They shoved her onto a board and hurried away,
All that mangled goodness still murmuring - 
		"My poker am my fife;
		n' my pan am my drum;
		Gawd damn de niggers - 
		An' a bum!! - bum! - bu -"
