"WAKE, GOD, AND ARM"

Wake, God, and arm‚Äîthis is no time for sleep;  
Now that stark madness fires ten million men,
And murder laughs and stabs and laughs again, 
And blind lust plunges where it feared to creep. 
Brushing Thy hand the winged navies sweep; 
Each night sends down a hideous surprise -  
Even the sky drips war . . . and clean and wise 
Nations go forth to their own burial heap.

Where art Thou, God, these torn and shattering days?
Where is Thine excellent wrath, Thy powerful word?
Still - Thou art still - impotent and absurd;
A cautious god, feeble and fat with praise.
Thou too, arise and arm! Why shouldst Thou be
Keeping, with Death, this black neutrality.
