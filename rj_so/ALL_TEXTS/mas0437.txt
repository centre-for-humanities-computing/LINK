GOD'S WAR

They said: "Three thousand stars in Heaven's 
	placesYour unassisted eye shine clear before, 
And in what seem those interstellar spaces 
Abide and move a hundred million more.

"Serene they swing their fearful revolutions	In destined order and in choral awe 
Of Him that holds the Riddle's Sev'n Solutions 
	Fast in the scroll of His unriddled Law.

"Consider them and cease from vain contending,	To better evil that His time will right; 
The worlds obey, keep thou His peace unending -  
	The stars were made to make the darkness light."

I looked; yet as I looked I read the story: 
	He flung those spiral systems into space; 
But only through themselves they wrought His glory, 
	Each burned its way to its contested place.

From these stern stars content, secure, commanding,	The message comes that I have waited long - 
The peace of God that passeth understanding 
	Springs from God's War against invading Wrong!
