HORSES!

Sing the far-famed horses of history, 
Sing the steeds of the mighty generals, 
Steeds of knights who fought in the tourney; 
	Sing Bucephalus, sing Al Borak, 
	Wondrous flying steed of the Prophet; 
	Sing of Reksh, the charger of Rustum, 
	Sing Roan Barbary, sing Black Saladin, 
	Sing the Corsican's gallant Marengo -  
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

		For the Gray Mare is the better horse, 
		For the furrow or for the course -  
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

		Staunch and steady though nervous and fine, 
		Keen, alert to the bit and the line; 
		Patiently plodding, pulling the share, 
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

Sing the star-named coursers of Araby, 
Sing the blue-blood mettlesome racer,
Sing the wild horses, sing the war-horses -  
Sing the thundering hooves of the pampas -  
Sing the horse of a hundred battles, 
Snuffing afar the good scent of carnage, 
Saying "Ha, ha !" in the face of the trumpets -  
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

		Fit and eager, not caring a rap 
		For the heaviest handicap; 
		First at the goal without turning a hair -  
		My money on the Gray Mare!

Sing the horses of song and story - 
Sing the tameless horses of Helios -  
Xanthos, best-loved steed of Achilles;
Sing the praise of the good horse Pegasus;
Sing Rosinante . , , sing if you dare
That terror-shod Pale Horse of Apocalypse -   
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

		For the Gray Mare is the better horse, 
		Take her for better, take her for worse -  
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!

		Now tingling in sinews and nerves she hears 
		Call of the pampas a-surge in her ears! 
		Bit in her teeth, heels in the air -  
		I'll sing the Gray Mare!
