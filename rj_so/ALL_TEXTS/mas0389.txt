THE UNBROKEN MARCH

Straight for the goal with their footsteps unfaltering; 
	On to the payment with never a pause; 
		Lion of heart for the challenge of sacrifice; 
Irish of spirit for Ireland's cause.

They drained their own cups to a pledge of their making: 
	To Cathleen ni Houlihan, Queen of our dreams;		They took a last look at the heart-broken hillsides; 
They heard the wild keening of sorrowful streams.

For the streams they were mourning with passioned abandon
	 As great waxed the waters on-sweeping from woe; 
		And the hills they climbed higher from pride in their 			lovers,Upreaching for heights where those lovers would go.

Ah, Cathleen ni Houlihan, brave is your anguish, 
	And tender the ache in your beautiful breast.		Aye, gather them close, they who love you so gladly,
And kiss the red gaps where their martyrdom pressed.

Their requiem sounds to the deeps of our list'ning, 
	Each hungering nook of our memory fills,		And mounts to a chorus, majestic and terrible, 
Played by the winds on the harp of the hills.

Oh they marched to tb.e payment with never a falter, 
	The same who are lying beneath the green sod.		But on goes the marching, the marching, the marching: 
'Tis Cathleen ni Houlihan marching with God.
