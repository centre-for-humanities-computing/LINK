AT THE TERMINAL

Here where the torrent is end-
	less, 
Here where the thousands have 
	crossed,All of the faces are friendless,	All of the man's kinship is lost. 
No one looks up at the other,	Here joy and comradeship end -  
Do you not see me, my brother?	Do you not know me, my friend?

Where do they wander, thus mingling 
		and parting; 
	What is the boon that their dumb lips 
		beseech;Why is each fiber aquiver and starting; 
	What is the goal they are straining to 
		reach?Lo, they are deaf to the rhapsodists' 
		thunder,	Now music dies ere it reaches their 
		ears,Twilight and dawn cannot waken their 
		wonder,	Nothing to them is the song of the 
		spheres.

Mirthless and mutely they throng every 
		stairway,	Never a moment their hearts are pos-
		sessedWith visions and dreams, but sorrow 
		and care weigh 
	Heavy on them and their wearisome 
		quest.

Here the pure sunshine turns bitter,	Heedless of wounds that exhaust, 
Mankind still fights for the glitter	And the true vision is lost.
Each one is blind to the other,	Blindly they grope to the end -  
Do you not know me, my brother?	Do you not see me, my friend?
