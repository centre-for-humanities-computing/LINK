WHEN THE SEVENTEEN CAME HOME

Nobody laughed when the seventeen came home. 
	It is one of our customs to kill men.
	But we always treat them with, reverence after we 
have done it.
	We send them out to die. But we use a colored flag, 
to show ourselves that it was not murder.
	Murder is better, I think. Murder without lies.
	Nobody laughed when the seventeen came home.
	But perhaps, under the flags, the seventeen laughed,
when they saw the people who had sent them out to 
die, standing in rows with their hats off, being sorry.
