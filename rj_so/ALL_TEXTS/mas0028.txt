MICE

Here's to the mice that scare the lions,   
Creeping into their cages. 
Here's to the fairy mice that bite 
The elephants fat and wise:
Hidden in the hay-pile while the elephant-thunder 
	rages.
Here's to the scurrying, timid mice, 
Through whom the proud cause dies.

Here's to the seeming accident
When all is planned and working,
All the wheels a-turning,
Not one serf a-shirking.
Here's to the hidden tunneling thing
That brings the mountain's groans.
Here's to the midnight scamps that gnaw;
Gnawing away the thrones.
