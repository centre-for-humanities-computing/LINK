SOCIAL PROGRESS

In days of old, so we've been told, 
	The strong man ruled the cliffs; 
He took a club to any dub	Sans wherefores, buts or ifs, 
And then took of the weaker's wealth	Whatever he thought right; 
He did this while he kept his health,	But after that - good night!

But modern days have modern ways	To turn the primal trick; 
The smallest shrimp, whose grip is limp,	May swing the biggest stick; 
And strong men gladly work for him	For part of what is theirs, 
And then when death his doused his glim	Keep working for the heirs.
