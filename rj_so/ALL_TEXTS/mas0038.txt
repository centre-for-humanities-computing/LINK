TO KIPLING

VILE singer of the bloody deeds of empire, 
	And of the bravery that exploits the poor, 
Exalter of subservience to masters,
	Bard of the race that bound and robbed the Boer - 

We note your metaphors that shine and glisten, 
	But, underneath your sounding verse, we see
The exploitation and the wide corruption,
	 The lying, and the vice, and misery.

Your people lay upon the backs of others - 
	The bullet, and the prison, and the rod, 
Wherewith ye scourge the races that subserve you,
	And then blaspheme by blaming it on God.
