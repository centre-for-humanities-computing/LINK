ON THE ROOF

Upon a lofty roof I lie, 
	Above the streets and gay, bazaars, 
Confronted by the sombre sky 
	And curious accusing stars, 
Come half defiant, half contrite, 
To parley with reproachful Night. 

There is no zest tonight for me 
	In gaudy things - the cabarets, 
The men that flush with rum-fed glee, 
	The women with enticing ways, 
The glamour of the avenue,  
Man's carnival of lust goes through. 

The hellicat I ask to dine 
	Detests me, I am so morose; 
The music vexes me, the wine 
	Is sickish and the cafe's close; 
And even on the street the crowd 
Bumps into me and laughs too loud. 

And all night long, no matter where 
	I wander, what I do or think, 
Albeit fuddled by the hair 
	Of women or the fumes of drink, 
I know the Night is gazing down 
So wistfully upon the town! 

Forlorn, like some still lovely nun, 
	New-vowed, from cloister gates ajar 
She gazes over, vespers done,  
	Into the lurid lupanar, 
And challenges the lives we lead, 
Her lovers, lost in lust and greed. 

In her deep mind remembrance stirs 
	Of ages ere Leviathan
 Upraised from trampled oaks and firs 
	Her vulgar countenance, and man 
Grew callous to her daisy-charms 
To clasp rose-passion in his arms -  

Oblivious of the pure delight 
	Of open plains and forests where 
No smoke arose to'cloud the sight 
	Or stench to taint the joyous air; 
Where in the mild winds' antiphons 
No factory crashed discordant tones.

Thus pondering an ancient age, 
The grave, reproachful Night looks 
	down 
Upon the filthy persiflage 
	And tawdry glamour of the town,
 A nun new-vowed that views the bawd, 
Her old loves garland and applaud. 

And often her vague challenge seems 
	To seek me out, in ali the heat 
Of drunken revels and the gleam 
	Of hoardings on the sinful street; 
And then aversion snaps the thong 
Of wine and lights and girls and song, 

And I must climb to some high roof 
	Above the city's lure and light, 
Confounded by the mute reproof 
	Of melancholy-visaged Night, 
And strive to answer, half inflamed 
By sullen anger, half ashamed.
