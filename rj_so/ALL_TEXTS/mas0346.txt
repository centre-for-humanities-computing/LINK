COB-WEBS

Cob-webs in the corner,
Grey and dusty,
Let them stay,
They make the room look lived in.

Cob-webs in my brain, 
Grey and dusty, 
I'll keep them there 
To catch butterflies 
That might flit through 
If I kept cleaning out 
(Like an efficient housewife) 
All the funny little corners 
Of my mind.
