VACATION PROTEST

Moonlight
And white sand,
And limbs of white
Pacing all night.
O free and unbewildered sky!

And is it I
Who on the morrow must return to work 
In fourteen articles of clothing 
And a derby?

O Night, my Mother, 
You have my secret when I say 
That I regard with loathing 
The world that men epitomize 
In fourteen articles of clothing 
And a derby.

For in that world 
Faith, hope and charity 
Wear fourteen articles of
	clothing each, 
And each a derby.
