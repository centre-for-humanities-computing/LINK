INCARCERATED

Ah, I could weep sometimes to go to the public 
	schools
And see little children sitting in long rows 
On hard board seats!
So many hours a day away from the green lanes and 
	butterflies,
So many hours away from the faces of mothers, the 
	ministries of home;
Sitting, sitting, oh, so patiently, expectantly -
Sitting in long rows on hard board seats.
The smug, pleased face of the school mistress!
The sour, lined face, the peaked, petulant, neurotic 
	face of the school mistress!
But once in a hundred times the face of a true Teacher 				- pedagogue - leader of children.
What is it all for, this wholesale incarceration of child-
	hood?
I demand of you to show cause why it should be. 
And I come to you with Nature's writ of habeas corpus, 
That you release these children sitting so patiently,
	pathetically -
Sitting in long rows on hard board seats.
