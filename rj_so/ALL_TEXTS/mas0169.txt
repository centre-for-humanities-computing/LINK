A STRANGER IN THE CITY

It is loneliest when the lights spring 
	out,When the city turns from working to 
	pleasure,And the shop girls put on rouge before 
	the mirrors,Anticipating, expecting. . . .I stand on the stairs of the ElevatedAnd I see men and women, together 
	everywhere,Meeting in corners, turning into res-
	taurant doors,Expecting, anticipating. . . .Below me a girl joins a boy who holds 
	violets,Beside me another girl, older but bright-
	eyed,Comes hurrying to a waiting man with 
	her explanation:"I got him to sleep first - I didn't want 
	him to see me go -"And their eyes meet tenderly as they go 
	off together. . . .Up past me the home going men climb,Some with bundles or magazines,And with the look of home-going in 
	their eyes;Men and women everywhere to-
	gether. . . .To my room in the boarding house or 
	the movies - alone - I go up the stairs slowly!
