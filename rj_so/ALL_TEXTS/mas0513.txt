THE FIRST GUN

Sitting down at last to think it over - 
Weary of the wrangle : It is his war, it is their
	 war,
It is no war of mine! -  
Sitting down to think it over,
To see if I can determine who it really was that broke
	the peace of the Powers -  
Not that any other will be innocent when one has
	found the first overt act -  
Seeking that act and actor none the less;

Suddenly in a flash it comes to me:
You, Glass of Perfectness and Mould of Ideality!
You, from your pedestal giving light to the world!
You, serene Arbitress that would be - 
You it was that broke the peace of the World Powers,
Yonder at Vera Cruz.
