A TRIBUTE

Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman
Are in prison, 
Although the night is tremblingly beautiful 
And the sound of water climbs down the rocks 
And the breath of the night air moves through multitudes
	and multitudes of leaves 
That love to waste themselves for the sake of the summer.

Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman 
Are in prison tonight,
But they have made themselves elemental forces,
Like the water that climbs down the rocks:
Like the wind in the leaves:
Like the gentle night that holds us:
They are working on our destinies:
They are forging the love of the nations:

Tonight they lie in prison.
