ARTEMIS

A voice - the voice of Artemis, resonant over the sea: 
	"Search through valleys and marshes, and ye shall come
	 	to me;	Over the vanishing tide-swept ribbon of shoreway come, 
	Into the hill-locked forest, for I am your mother and home.

"I, the childless and husbandless: I, the slender of feet, 
	Lithe of flank and of shoulder: unmaternal and fleet;All ye may crave Aphrodite: to me after Mary ye come - 	I the untamed am your mother; I am your lover and home.

"And when your voices are weary, and your songs are grown 
		harsh and old,	I shall not comfort nor coddle: my arms shall never enfold. 
Go seek your motherly goddess! - lay down your heads on her 
		breast - 	Ye shall speed to me fleetly, lightly, when ye have waked 
		from rest.
"My songs are songs for the strong ones, my rule is no rule for 
		the weak.	Over the shore and the mountains come - I am yours to seek. 
Swim the rivers swiftly; lightly and gladly run:	Ye pray to your motherly Marys: but I am the ultimate one."
