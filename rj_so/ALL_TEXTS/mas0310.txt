I KNOW

I know life's joy and beauty's aching 
	thrill.
I could be glad, if that were all I know. 
At night I've seen the forest in the snow. 
I've found Spring's first gold daffodil. 
I've looked into the sky all blue and still, 
And I have watched a field of lupines 
	blow.
I know life's joy and beauty's aching 
	thrill.
I could be glad if that were all I know. 
I've crushed my face 'gainst violets until 
I've lost myself‚Äîwatched dying embers 
	glow.
I have known love, and singing low 
I've hushed my babe to sleep as mothers 
	will.
I know life's joy and beauty's aching 
	thrill.
I could be glad if that were all I know.
