CHILDREN OF KINGS

The dry leaf blown along the dusty street  
	Is not so soon forgot as one of these - 
	The children learning prayers at Mammon's knees, 
Whose small starved bodies and whose weary feet 
A million and a million times repeat
	The short same way that the machine decrees; 
	Treaders of wine, their portion is the lees -  
Weavers of cushions for old Mammon's seat.

The daylight is more weary than the dark - 
	The dark more weary than the daylight was - 
Why wait ye? Ah - how long before the spark
	Shall light the kindling that shall burn his throne?
A million and a million times ye pause - 
	While Mammon claims your children for his own.
