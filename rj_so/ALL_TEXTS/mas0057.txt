WINDOW SHOPPING

Some of the women are wearing dark blue coat-suits,
Carefully hiding all their lacy blouses,
And all their brushed and satin-burnished tresses
Are primly gathered under stern black sailors.
These and the other women, dingy and motley,
With skirts pulled out of shape by anemic children - 
All of the women are gazing into windows.

Gazing at waxy figures in filmy dresses,
Dancing gowns of lace bedraped with roses,
Opera cloaks of oriental colors,
Scarfs and jeweled bags and artful slippers,
Persian-patterned cloth in pastel shades;
As if the world's whole treasure-trove were gathered
Here under glass and priced and labeled "Paris."

Some of the women return to close-shut houses, 
Where blank forbidding doors shut in the beauty 
Of dull harmonious walls and rugs and silver, 
And shut out the light of moon and star and sunset: 
The others turn to streets where all that is ugly, 
Out and in, is unconcealed and shameless.

But we who sit here making conversation, 
Hiding our thoughts in words polite and pleasant,
Or sad and scornful - endlessly pretending -  
What have we done with last night's moony magic, 
Savor of dawn with flush of new adventure, 
Vigor of passionate sorrow and joy, and motion, and 
	music,
Fervor and faith and all-fulfilled desire?
All shut up in the world's shop-window of dreams.
