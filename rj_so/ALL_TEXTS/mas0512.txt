THE SMOKERS

In the rear of the car we sat, 
The stranger and I. 
He was big and fat, 
With the fleshiness of a pig.
His round, moon-face 
Was as barren of thought and feeling 
As the face of a drowsy cow -  
And the soft rolls of meat 
Overhung all sides of the seat.

Both of us puffed at fragrant cigars,
Flushing our lungs with huge mouthfuls of smoke
Which afterwards oozed out from the nostrils
In thin spiral waves - 
And we sighed contentedly.
For a lingering second our eyes met
And we smiled - 
The smile of an ageless comradeship.
