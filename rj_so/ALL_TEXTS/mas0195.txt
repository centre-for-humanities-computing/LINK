TO A WEEPING WILLOW

You hypocrite!
You sly deceiver! 
I have watched you fold your hands and sit 
With your head bowed the slightest bit, 
And your body bending and swaying,
 As though you were praying 
Like a devout and rapt believer. 
You knew that folks were looking and you were 
Quite pleased with the effect of it. 
Your over-mournful mien; 
Your meek and languid stir; 
Your widow's weeds of trailing green; 
Your grief in resignation clad. . . . 
You seemed so chastely, delicately sad.

You bold young hypocrite -  
I know you now!
Last night when every light was out,
I saw you wave one beckoning bough
And, with a swift and passionate shout,
The storm sprang up - and you, you exquisite,
You laughed a welcome to that savage lout. . . .
I heard the thunder of his heavy boots.
And in that dark and rushing weather,
You clung together;
Safe, with your secret in the night's great cover, 
You and your lover.

I saw his windy fingers in your hair;
I saw you tremble and try to tear
Free from your roots
In a headlong rush to him.
His face was dim,
But I could hear his kisses in the rain;
And I could see your arms clasp and unclasp.
His rough, impetuous grasp
Shook you, and you let fall
Your torn and futile weeds, or flung them all
Joyfully in the air;
Like buoyant flags to sing above
The stark and shameless victory of love.
