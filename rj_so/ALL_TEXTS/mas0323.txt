WHEN THE LEAVES COME OUT

The hills are very bare and cold and lonely;  
	I wonder what the future months will bring? 
The strike is on - our strength would win, if only - 
	O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!

	They've got us down - their martial lines enfold us; 
	They've thrown us out to feel the winter's sting, 
And yet, by God, those curs could never hold us, 
	Nor could the dogs of hell do such a thing!

It isn't just to see the hills beside me
	Grow fresh and green with every growing thing.
I only want the leaves to come and hide me, 
	To cover up my vengeful wandering.

I will not watch the floating clouds that hover 
	Above the birds that warble on the wing;
I want to use this GUN from under cover -  
	O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!

You see them there below, the damned scab-herders!
	Those puppets on the greedy Owners' String; 
We'll make them pay for all their dirty murders - 
	We'll show them how a starving hate can sting!

They riddled us with volley after volley;
	We heard their speeding bullets zip and ring, 
But soon we'll make them suffer for their folly - 
	O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!
