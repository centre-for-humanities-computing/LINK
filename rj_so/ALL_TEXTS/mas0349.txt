CITY DAWN

Gray dawn comes over the purple rooftops, 
Leprous dawn, white-headed, heavy, torpid,
 Ancient-footed, gravid with unborn thunders, 
	Comes to the city.

Houses sleep: - the house of pain and of wonder, 
Rearing, ward on ward, and story on story, 
Up to the sky, the battle of generations 
	Unborn and dying.

Houses sleep: - the house of lust and loud music, 
Prudently veiled, discreetly hooded and silenced, 
Sodden with sleep and fruitless futile exhaustion, 
	Sleeps in the dawning.

Purple roofs to the far horizon -  
Oh ye sleepers! - dawn comes to your byeways! 
Leprous dawn, ancient-footed and gravid 
	With unborn thunders.
