PROVINCETOWN

A summer town where all the folks are old,
The fishers old with labor, and the rest 
With Life, or Art, or some exotic thing. 
A simple child who loved to run and laugh, 
And look among the pebbles, and play ball, 
Were lonely-hearted here. The gulls cry sadly
As their shadows drift across the sand.
