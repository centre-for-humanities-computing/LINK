THE CHERRY TREE

On the hillside, back of the house,
Green against the blue sky, with its white summer clouds,
Stands the old cherry tree, splotched now with dusky 
	red;
And under its broad, friendly branches,
On a mossy stone, chin-deep in the grass and clover,
Close by the old worm-fence
Sits a little three-year-old girl, with her lap full of 
	cherries.
Beneath her the low roof of the motherly farmhouse 
Spreads, among maple trees, hard by the road; 
Beyond that is a glimpse of a swift mountain river. 
Above her the swallows wheel and chatter -  
The only sound, save a sleepy distant cock-crow. 
What is she thinking about, as she nibbles and looks, 
This child with the cherry-stained lips and fingers, 
Out of her wide blue eyes, 
Over it all?
I only know it is so much fresher and fairer
Than my eyes see or my heart knows,
I could cry with longing to sit as a child again,
In the grass on the hillside, under the cherry tree,
