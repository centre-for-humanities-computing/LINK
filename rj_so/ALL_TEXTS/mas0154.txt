TO ONE WITHOUT WORK

You with the will to live and work
	Who are given a chance to starve and die, 
There is labor still, unless you shirk, 
	There is death to profit by.

If it be death must cure and end 
	The hunger and the human need,
Kill not only yourself, my friend, 
	But one of these who feed,

Who feed too well and will not see 
	The starving mouths and hearts about..
Kill, with yourself, a king - or me -  
	To help you work it out!
