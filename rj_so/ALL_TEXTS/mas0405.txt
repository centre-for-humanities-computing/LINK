IN THE ART INSTITUTE

At last we let each other go, And I left: you
Left the demand and the desire of you, 
And all our windings in and out 
And bickerings of love: 
And I was presently
Wandering through corridors and rooms of 
	pictures;
Waiting for my mind to sharpen again 
Out of its blur.

Now was stern air to breathe; 
High, rational; Clear of you and me; 
Impersonal air.
The gold and bronze medals in their ordered
	cases - 
Round, clean-edged - 
Cooled me.
The tossing and tumbling of my body drew
	itself into form,
Into poise,
Looking at their fine symmetry of being.
