WHAT DO I KNOW OF THE WAR?

What do I know of the battle-field? 
	Nothing at all - but there he lies 
Where harvest winds once blew their yield 
	And moon-light falls on his eyes.

That's what I know of the battle-field;	And that I know and nothing more,
His song is hushed, his lips are sealed - 	That's all I know of the war.

Nations may fall on the battle-field, 
	Victor and vanquished come and goAnd flowers bloom where the cannon pealed -  
	\But only this do I know.
