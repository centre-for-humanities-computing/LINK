ON THE RIALTO: CHICAGO

I am a loophound; twenty years or 
	more;Bred in the city, pacing with the lights; 
Friend of the rumble and the mighty 
	roar;Dodging the sun, and staying up o' 
	nights.

Cronie of pleasures melting in an hour; 
High executioner of painted time. 
Brimmed with the spirit of a paper 
	flower,Running my gamut like a worn out 
	rhyme.

Sunk in a man-made gorge, where stars 
	are dim;Bound by the crushing buildings, sitting 
	high, -God of the lights, disciple of the whim, 
Knight of the screaming, hectic town, 
	am I.
