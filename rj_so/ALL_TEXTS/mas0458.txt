PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN

He slobbers over sentimental plays 
	And sniffles over sentimental songs. 
	He tells you often how he sadly longs
For the ideals of the dear, old days.
In gatherings he is the first to raise
	His voice against "our country's shameful 
		wrongs."
	He storms at greed. His hard, flat tone pro-
		longs
The hymns and mumbled platitudes of praise.

I heard him at his office Friday past:
	"Look here," he said, "their talk is all a bluff; 
You mark my words, this thing will never last.
	 Let them walk out - they'll come back quick 
		enough. . . 
We'll have all hands at work, and working 
		fast!
How do they think we're running this - for 
		love?"
