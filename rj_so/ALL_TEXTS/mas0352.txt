FROM THE TOWER
xx He stars in the sky
xx Are silver 
They twinkle like ice. 
The stars on the earth 
Are golden
They beckon and smile. 
Little black people 
Flutter about them, 
In and out and across. . . .

The city is a great grey dragon 
Reaching out with its long claws 
And clutching the water. 
Winding its sprawling body 
Over the land,
Lashing the purple hills with its tail.

There is a mist before my eyes
And in my heart are tears.
In a little while, beloved,
I will go down into those crooked streets
Smiling and looking about me
When I know there is nothing
Any more
To search for
Nor any goal to reach.
