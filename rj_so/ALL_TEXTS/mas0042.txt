OLD GLORY AT CALUMET

When first we put the collar off	And turned our backs upon the pit,
 We took the old flag off the shelf
	 And shook the creases out of it.

It set a light in our blear eyes	And straightened up our backs again, 
And Dutchman, Dago, Slav and Finn, 
	It made us comrades and free men.

At daybreak as we made our rounds	By shaft and pit where once we slaved,The rising sun lit up the flag	That as our marching banner waved.

Through all the months of leaf and shine	We grit our teeth and held it high, 
And through the months of snow and chill	With tightened belts and "never-say-die!"

And when the swords of Uncle Sam's	Hired bullies in the open street 
Struck down his flag, 'twas Pole and Finn	That saved it from insulting feet.

But when the masters starved us out 
	And broke our hearts, and one by oneWe slipped the collar on again	And turned our backs upon the sun,

We knew that henceforth each poor slave	Must fight and bargain for himself, 
And secretly and with a blush	We laid Old Glory on the shelf.
