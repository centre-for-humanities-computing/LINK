TO A GENTLEMAN REFORMER

Keep it - your torn and rotting decency, 
	Your antique toga with its quaint misfit. 
	Keep it - the world has little use for it,
Or swaddled truths too bashful to be free.
This is no age for sick humility,
	Or queasy goodness without strength enough 
	To dare the keen and hungry edge of love,
Or Fear that wraps itself in chastity.

Hide in its crumbling folds. How should you 
		know
That Virtue may be dirty and can grow
	Furtive and festering in a mind obscene. 
How should you know the world's glad, vulgar 
		heart,
The sensual health that is the richest part 
	Of Life; so frankly carnal - and so clean.
