SATURDAY NIGHT

Down through the passionate street, an infinite 
	glory is streaming, 
Touching the restless pageant with glamour and
	light;
And a mirth is stripping their sloth and prodding them
	forth to a dreaming, 
Tugging, tugging away at their heart in the night! 
And oh, to what hot desires does this endless pageant
	surrender? - 
This mist of eddying faces - this hungering throng! 
For over it, over it all, an ineffable, conquering splen-
	dour
Wakes the heart, the heart of the night to song!

There's a bleary, carroty woman that shambles along 
	and grumbles; 
There are white-faced smiling mothers forgetting 
	their woe;
There's a groggy, besotted drunkard who blankly blinks
	and mumbles, -  
He cannot know what it means - this glamour and 
	glow!
And there, past a riot of color, where flaunting windows
	 are flaring,
Come the adventuring youths, careless and free; 
And faces of laughing girls challenge them forth to a 
	daring....
Faces of Helen....sea on triumphant sea....

Down through the passionate street, an infinite glory is 
	streaming,
Touching the restless pageant with glamour and light; 
And a mirth is stripping their sloth and prodding them 
	forth to a dreaming - 
Tugging, tugging away at their heart in the night! 
And oh, to what hot desires does this endless pageant 
	surrender? - 
This mist of eddying faces‚Äîthis hungering throng! 
For over it, over it all, an ineffable, conquering splen-
	dour
Wakes the heart, the heart of the night to song!
