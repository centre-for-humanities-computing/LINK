SISTER OF MINE

Our ceiling is the sidewalk of the street. 
So we get light enough to see the stitches, it's made of 
	glass;
Not common glass you see the sky through, 
But frosted over so the men down here, 
(They're that kind of men)
Can't look up along the stockings of the women that pass.
Clatterty-bang! Bangety-clatter! The shoes crash all day 
	long on the glass.
Sometimes it stabs hot into your heart and hurts so you sob;
Sometimes it just makes you mad - mad clean through like 
	when somebody you hate hits you in the face.
Over my head a hole is broken in the glass.
I can see an awniug up above, and beside the hole this morn-
	ing I saw something else.
I could not make it out at first.
Then I sort of guessed it was a flower.
It must have dropped from some woman's waist: 
That's the only way flowers come to this part of town. 
It lay there quite still on the glass till someone kicked it, 
Then another and another, but the wind blew it back to the
	very edge of the hole: 
Another boot kicked it in.
God, I was glad to see it, where it fell, right in my lap.
I closed my hand over it for a moment, the poor battered,
	decrepit thing. 
(Yet a tiny bit fragrant still.)
When nobody was looking I slipped it into my bosom to
	keep it warm. 
It's a sister of mine, that rose.
Me they kicked around like that for a time, back and forth,
	back and forth; 
Finally, they kicked me down a hole, too, and here I am -  
With the rose.
