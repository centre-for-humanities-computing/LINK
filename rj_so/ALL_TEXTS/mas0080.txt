JOE

It'S strange without you. I do not like it.
	I want to see you coming down the street in the 
	gay woolly stockings and that bright green sweater.
I want you to open the door of my house and
	brightly call "Hello!"
We used to rage about the way you kept us waiting - 
Honest now, were you ever on time anywhere
?But I'd wait - oh, I can't say how long I wouldn't 
	wait if there was any chance of your finally 
	swinging along and charming away my exasperation.
That was a mean advantage - 
Letting us wait and then spoiling our grievance with 
	a smile.
I want to sit over a drink with you and talk about 
	the I. W. W. and the damned magazines and the 
	Germans; I want to argue with you about building 
	book shelves and planting bulbs.
I want awfully to tell you a joke I heard yesterday.
And now that you are gone I want intensely to find 
	you.
What were you, Joe? I don't think any of us really
	 know.
Many are talking about your warmth, 
	but there was something diamond hard in you,
Something unyielding and inexorable 
	to all not you.
Many are talking about your gayety; 
	none of them loved it more than I did,
But I want now to know about those 
	reservations; I want to know 
	the you that brooded and lived alone.
They say you were so sunny; but ah,
	you were so subtle. 
Much I do not know, but this I
	know - 
You saw things straight; nobody put
	it over very hard on you. 
The thing in you that thought was
	like a knife blade, 
Muddling and messing made you sick. 
Your scorn put the crimp in a lot of
	twaddle that goes on among ourkind of folks - 
How I'd like to hear you cuss some
	of them out again! 
Graceful levity - fiery dissatisfactions. 
Debonair and passionate.
 Much I do not know and never shall,
	but this I know: 
I feel the sway of beauty when I
	think of you. 
A fresh breeze; a shining point; 
Pure warmth; pure hardness. 
Much given and something withheld; 
A jest - a caress - an outrageous little
	 song. A gift. A halt in
	speech - a keen, grave look of
	understanding. 
Undependable and yet deeply there: 
Vivid and unforgetable. 
Is that at all you ? Would you laugh
	if you saw this? 
Well, laugh, but I say, again,
Unforgetable.
Strong clear violet; the flash of steel;
The life of the party - a tree way off by itself.
Oh, what's the use? I can't.
I only know my throat's all tight with the longing 
	to have you open the door of my house and 
	brightly call "Hello!"
