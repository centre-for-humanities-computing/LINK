PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT

"I do not want to speak of it," he said,
	And told me that the war was a disgrace,
A blot, I think he said, upon the face 
Of Progress. Man must hang his head 
Each morning when he reads of men left dead
	Upon the blood-soaked fields. Only one place
	Preserves the high ideals of the race -  
America, where bullets turn to bread.

"Why, look," he warmed up to his noble text,
	 "Look at this country's great neutrality;
		And how we've prospered in it. If that strife 
Continues through this summer and the next, 
	No one can tell how prosperous we'll be . . . 
		Just one more year - and we'll be made for life!"
