HELOISE SANS ABELARD

In the cool, calm palace of prayer 
	She sought her haven of dreams;
She gave up her dower of air, 
	Of stars, and cities, and streams.

On the cold, sweet steps of prayer 
	She sought what young girls seek;
She laid her bosom bare,
	And asked for the stones to speak.

Who wonders she could not hear 
	What silence and stones belie?
Who wonders where love may steer? 
	Not I, not I, not I!

O passionate Heloise,
	I, too, have lived under the ban, 
With seven hundred professors,
	And not a single man.
