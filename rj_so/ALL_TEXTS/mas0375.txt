CONQUEST

White women in the houses	And strange men in the street. 
Muddy horses in the fields,	Trampling down the wheat.

And so they took the village 
	Whose men were all away.Women screamed and soldiers laughed -  
	It was a glorious day!

But over on the hill-side 
	Up which the foot path led,There was a town they could not take -  
	The village of the dead.
