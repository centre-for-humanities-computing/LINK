TO EVERETT P. WHEELER

("Women are often tempters to sexual sin and delight init.......A recent report of a female probation officer relates that some of the girls who, as we say euphemistically 'had gone astray' owned to her that they enjoyed the life of the evil house." - Everett P. Wheeler; The Case Against Woman Suffrage, published by the Man-Suffrage Association Opposed to Political Suffrage for Women.) 

It may be so, good sir, it may be so,
Not all who sin are tempted‚Äîthat we know: 
It may be darker things than this are true, 
And yet, upon my soul, if I were you -  
A man, no longer young, at peace, secured
From all that tempting women have endured 
Of poverty and ignorance and fear 
And joy that make youth terrible and dear, 
If I were you, before I took my pen 
And wrote those words to hearten other men, 
And give them greater sense of moral ease 
In the long score of common sins like these, 
If I were you, I would have held my hand 
In fire.
	Ah, well; you would not understand.
