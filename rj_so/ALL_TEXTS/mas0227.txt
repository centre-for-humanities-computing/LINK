THE KANAWHA STRIKER

Good God ! Must I now meekly bend my head
	And cringe back to that gloom I know so well? 
	Forget the wrongs my tongue may never tell,
Forget the plea they silenced with their lead,
Forget the hillside strewn with murdered deadW
	here once they drove me‚Äîmocked me when I fell 
	All black and bloody by their holes of hell,
While all my loved ones wept uncomforted?

Is this the land my fathers fought to own -  
Here where they curse me‚Äîbeaten and alone?
	But God, it's cold! My children sob and cry!  
Shall I go back into the mines and wait, 
And lash the conflagation of my hate - 
	Or shall I stand and fight them till I die!
