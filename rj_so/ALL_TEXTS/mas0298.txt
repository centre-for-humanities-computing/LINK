ROOFS

I stood upon a little hill,
	And there before my eyes 
Were all the roofs that ever man 
	Did sinfully devise.

Here was a great cathedral tower,
	And there a dome of gilt; 
No bit of April green showed through
	These things that hands had built.

And turrets square, and turrets round,
	And turrets tall were there; 
A Gothic forest arrowed up
	To prick the sooty air.

And humble cottage roofs of thatch
	With slates were huddled in; 
Gray spires flung shadows of the cross
	On roofs that sheltered sin.

Low eaves and fretted cornices,
	And leagues of ruddy tile - 
Why, there were roofs of every age
	And roofs of every style! 

"Hullo!" says I, "and here's a sight!
	This must be London Town;" 
And sure! I met a hatted man
	Who bade me foot it down.

"We've roofs enough to house the world,
	And roofs to spare," says he; 
"Come, take your head from out of doors -
	Here's hospitality."

And there I stood, all in the dawn,
	Upon that little hill, 
And that strange, hatted, smiling man,
	A-wishing of me ill.

"Walk down," says he, "and choose your inn -
	As pleasant as you please;" 
And all the while I smelt the moor.
	Dew-sweet upon the breeze.

"I'm for the Road again, man dear;
	I'll find a roof," says I; 
And there upon that little hill
	I gave him gay good-by.
