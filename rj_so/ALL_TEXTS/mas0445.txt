PRIESTS

Priests are in bad odor,
And yet there shall be no lack of them . . . 
The skies shall not lack a spokesman, 
Nor the spirit of man a voice and a gesture . . .

Not garbed nor churched, 
Yet, as of old, in loneliness and anguish, 
They shall come eating and drinking among us, 
With scourge, pity, and prayer.
