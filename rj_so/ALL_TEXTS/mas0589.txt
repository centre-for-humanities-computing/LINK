THE MARSH

Orange and red of the marshes
	and joy of my heart! 
Your color that laughs to the sky and
	that flaunts in the wind, 
Is the spirit of courage gone out from
	the souls of dead heroes, 
To bloom in the lonely white sunshine,
	uplifted to God.

Under and through the long grass is
	the glimmer of water: 
The glimmer of dreams that has flowed
	in the souls of dead poets, 
And when they were dammed behind
	words, slipped away through the
	sand,
O dreams of my heart, you are shin-
	ing among the long grasses!

I lift up my face to the pungent smell
	of the marsh. 
The crying unrest and the hidden hope
	of adventure 
I breathe, and shall never again be
	serene like the oak trees,
 Content, like the meadow - I follow my
	soul o'er the marshes!
