SONNET

How futile is all thinking against this!
	 How exquisite is the air grown, and the skies;
	The moments flutter by like butterflies: 
Bright butterflies, whose passage is a kiss, 
Leaving upon our faces a bright bliss;
	A longing and desire beyond surmise 
Within our hearts; a loveliness which is
	Now here, now there, and now within your eyes.

Now changing, now expiring, now reborn, 
	Now silent and now singing; glorious
Across the world at evening and at morn:
	 Ah, if our death should find our Heaven thus,
As the exquisite moments flutter by,
Colored and perfumed, each a butterfly!
