TREES

NEW GROWTH
	Did you not see the trees,
	The little, eager trees,
	Lifting impetuous branches to the caress
	Of an unheeding wind?

	You might have stopped to speak as you passed by.

HORSE CHESTNUT
	Still it is Spring
	But now the great horse chestnut
	Unrolls its sudden leaves
	And in the sweet May dusk
	Lifts gleaming candles
	At the waiting shrine of Summer.
