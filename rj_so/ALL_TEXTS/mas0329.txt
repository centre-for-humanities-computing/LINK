A CUSTOMER

He said he did not want to look at any goods; 
His stock was very large; brooches were slow, 
	lockets were dead as a door nail. 
Business in general was worse than dull, and then be-
	sidesThings didn't look so rosy for the fall.And so we sat, and argued for an hour. . . .He said if people didn't talk so much, there wouldn't 
	be all this unrest - Our crops were coming on all right, and we're a pros-
	perous country -It's talk about this thing and that thing,Worrying and threshing over matters that don't con-
	cern them,That makes dissatisfaction and distrust.Things always take care of themselves, he said;So why excite ourselves about politics, or the war in 
	Mexico, or hard times;Folks only hurt business by talking about labor 
	troubles and strikes. . . .I asked him had he read about the state of affairs in 
	Colorado,Where one man, stubborn with prejudice and many 
	million dollars, had forced a civil war;Where the law had been put into the hands of mining 
	companies and men in their employ made dep-
	uties and soldiers;Where hired thugs, employed as the militia, poured 
	kerosene upon the strikers' tents - and then ap-
	plied the torch;Where machine-guns had been used to mow down	women and children; 
And where more lives had been lost in one day than	in our patriotic vengeance upon Mexico. . . . 
Yes, he said, he had heard about it. 
It really was too bad. Something, he supposed, ought	to be done. . . .And what did I think would take the place of bar-
	pins for the summer? . . .He was a medium-sized man, with thin brown hair	and pinkish cheeks, 
And he was always smiling.Yet I felt that this man was going to bring about the 
	revolution - Bring it quicker - make it bloodier - With his hard, careful apathy, and his placid, shrug-
	ging unconcern.
