TO MY HUSBAND

H wears a little ruff, your soul,Stiff-starched and pointed, very prim; 
And all his thoughts are measured thoughts, 
And all his ways are ruled and trim,

Up and down his world he goes,Turning each corner sharp and square,And to each strange uneven stepGives the crisp challenge: "Who goes there!"

So neat, so disciplined a soul 
I have not seen on any mart - 

What is this dear defenseless thing 
Crumpled and warm upon my heart?
