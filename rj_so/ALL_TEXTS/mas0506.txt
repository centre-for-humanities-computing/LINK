UM-YUM

Ship me to Finland (in summer) or 
		Vinland, 
	Or Greece or Britannia the 
		murky;But let me cut Rome for and scoot away 
		home for	The months of the toothsomy turkey! 
Yet not to the boasted big gobbler 
		brown roasted 
	Is sung this gay tralalaloo: 
Though fine on the platters it never 
		quite matters 
	Till turned to - um-yum - Turkey 
			Stew.

Think how it glides down and melts 
		down and slides down - 
	This stew that a glutton might dream 
		of;How joyous to taste it, how sinful to 
		waste it -  
	This dish that it's bliss to sniff steam 
		of!If I were as rich as some trusty trust		which has 
	Saved up - say - a million or two, 
I'd take winter boarders and O. K. their		orders	For - oh that - um-yum - Turkey Stew.Delicate light meat‚Äîambrosial white
		 meat - 	And dark meat so mixed that they 
		come where 
They join with a splendid concoction of
		blended	Aromas from Heaven or somewhere. 
In fact, at my finish when shrunk bone 
		and skinnish 
	Don't buy me a tombstone but do - 
Old chap - if you love me, just set up 
		above me 
	A bowl of um-yum Turkey Stew.
