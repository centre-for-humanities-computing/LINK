EUROPE

Since Athens died, the life that is a light 
Has never shone in Europe. Alien moods,
The oriental morbid sanctitudes, 
Have darkened on her like the fear of night. 
In happy augury we dared to guess 
That her pure spirit shot one sunny glance 
Of paganry across the fields of France, 
Clear startling this dim fog of soulfulness.

But now, with arms and carnage and the cries
Of Holy Murder, rolling to the clouds
Her bloody-shadowed smoke of sacrifice, 
The Superstition conquers, and the shrouds 
Of sanctimony lay their murky blight, 
Where shone of old the immortal-seeming light.
