REMINISCENCES

The other side of Death, one night, 
	Walked out a youth and maid;
And they reviewed (as children might 
	A game that they had played)
The battle they had died to fight,
	The cost they both had paid.

"I heard - or seemed to hear," she said, 
	"Far voices, seemed to see
St. Michael point me to a sword 
	To set my country free;
With men, a man, I fought," her head 
	Drooped forward wearily.

The boy assented with a nod.
	"Like me," he said, "beguiled.
A dove - a voice from heaven - odd 
	My fancies were, and wild!
I thought I was the son of God,"
	He said, and, sadly, smiled.
