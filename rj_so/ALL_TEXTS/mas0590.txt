THE LUCKY MAN

When people cannot understand 
A fellow's ways, they call him 
	mad.
My wife was Mabel Wilkerson, 
The prettiest woman in Hamlin
	County. 
Ask any man. 
Oh, she was faithful, 
And as nice as could be; 
Yet I left her and ran away with
	Nora Frye. 
Who is pale, and stupid, and hasn't
	got much hair.

You see, when I was courting Mabel, 
I used to think that if I ever had the 
	luck
To marry her, I'd walk along the 
	street
With her on my arm and hear men 
	say:
"Gad! She is beautiful. How did he 
	ever win her?"

I had the luck; 
I walked along the street 
With Mabel on my arm, and heard
	men say: 
"She's beautiful! I wonder what 
She sees in him?" 
Until I ran away with Nora Frye, 
Who is pale, and stupid, and hasn't
	got much hair.
