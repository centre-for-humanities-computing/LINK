REFLECTIONS OF A STRONG MAN

I am elected
A million people dance like dervishes, 
They blow tin whistles 
And shriek my name.

I am a strong man. 
My strong teeth shine, 
My children shout with glee, 
My wife falls upon my strong bosom  
And weeps,| 
But my strong soul is unmoved.

Alone, I bend my knees,
And thank Thee, Lord,
And my Saviour, Jesus Christ,
That I am a strong man.
That I studied the law and obeyed it.
That I worked hard over my cases and
	 mastered them.  
That I went every Sunday to the Bap-
	tist church.
That I was not too intimate with the 
	Rockefellers,
And yet intimate enough.
That I did not get drunk. 
That I did not fornicate. 
That I did not sympathize. 
That I did not have ideas.
That I am a strong man.

I thank Thee, Lord,
And my Saviour, Jesus Christ.
And pretty soon I will get busy,
 And show the Mexicans and the rail-
	waymen 
How strong I am.
