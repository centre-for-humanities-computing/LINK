THE OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN

You round a long green curve of trees 
And there it is, A Paisley shawl 
Has not the pattern or the grace 
Of this old fashioned place.Bright groups of budded peonies 
Exchange fine secrets. Silken, gowned 
Poppies idly sip the sun,And pansies, prim in little mitts 
And bonnets, whisper bits
Of gossip. Through the leafy ground 
A blackbird walks and cocks his head 
As though he said: "I'm favorite here,"And motorists may not come near."
