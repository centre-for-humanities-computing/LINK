THE GOLDEN MIRACLE

Do ye ask for a sign, O ye of little faith? 
Do ye doubt and stand slant-eyed
When bread and wine become the blessed body
	and blood 
Of dear Lord Jesus Christ?

De ye summon your Baals, Science and the Modern 
	Spirit,
To bear witness for you?

Truly ye are a perverse and balky generation
!For every day ye see a greater miracle,
A more wonderful transformation, never resting,
	belting the world; 
The lift and glow of youth, the vigor of maturity,
	the trembling haste of age, become gold; 
The splashed blood of workers on the spread rails
	and the keen-edged machine-blades, 
The fragrant smell of sacrificial woman-flesh on 
	the lust-altars, 
The toiling children, grayer than gray age, 
Turned into gold;
The packed slums and lean farm-houses, the loath-
	some food, the water swarming with death,
Aye, and the souls, the light, of humankind, all 
	become gold - 
Dumb gold, that can hardly tell its breathing origin.

I am ashamed of my feeble God and his well-
	meaning son,
 And their elementary miracles! 
Ye scoffers and doubters, scoff and doubt no more!
Look upon this greater miracle, and worship!
