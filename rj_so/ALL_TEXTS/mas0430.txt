A SUFFRAGIST

How can you other married women 
Sit so smugly in your steam-
	heated houses 
Placidly embroidering or reading the
	latest best-seller 
Or shrieking over your auction scores 
While millions and millions of women
	are being exploited by their em-
	ployers? 
But what do you care? 
You are not even interested. 
You are not aware that little children
	are whipped 
To keep them awake in the canneries. 
Or how could you continue to be house 
	cats
Fed and warmed and petted and pur-
	ring
Only rousing when your place on the 
	hearth is threatened?
