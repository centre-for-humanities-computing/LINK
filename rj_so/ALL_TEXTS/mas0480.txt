HUNGER

I have heard that the tides yearn for the moon,
And the hearts of men for the Spring, 
That the mountains reach eternally to the stars, 
And the winds hungering, cry in waste places, 
I have heard of a youth long ago, 
Who died for a dream; 
But is it not odd that I should see 
In one face, 
The angular, gray face 
Of a worked-out, dull old woman, 
Staring into a shop-window, 
All of these things?
