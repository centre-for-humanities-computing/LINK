TO SHELLEY

OH, thou chief son of liberty, whose days 
	Were brief as thy power over men is long, 
Keep my soul young, till, like to thine, it blaze, 
	Like fire in a great wind, against all wrong - 
And century after century wake again 
Prophetic power and passion in the world's young men.

And let no man who serves the Truth grow old, 
	Even though wrinkles gather 'round his eye,
Nor cringe and seek again the pampered fold;
	Nay, rather let him breast the storm and die - 
And may he perish ere he leaves his youth
That ever before men denies the bright god Truth.

Dead Souls! Dead Souls! They move along the street!
	Dead Souls in breathing flesh that dare not live!
 Bound with convention's grave-clothes, hands and feet,T
	hey take the stale modes their dead fathers give - 
Ah, different, Shelley, was that soul of thine; - 
But we must make new bottles for thy fiery wine.

We must sweep off the earth this vampire thing,
	This System clutching all men, great and small;
We will! - and then the spirit's upward wing
	 May unimpeded soar, and, each for all,
And all for each we'll live - and Man shall reign! - 
And thou and thy high hope will not have soared in vain!
