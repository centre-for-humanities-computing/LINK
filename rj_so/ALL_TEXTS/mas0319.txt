THE UKELELE 

Have you heard the shrill guitar and 
	ukelele? 
Decadently, palely, 
Whimpering, simpering

Whispering wickedly a bitter sort of 
	love, 

Clattering, flattering, 
Chattering a smattering of ticklish, fickle 
	love, 

Sickening, quickening 
The sad moon-madness in the bad moon- 
	light,

Kissing, hissing 
The hot delicious mystery of smooth, 
	soft flesh,

Tinkling, twinkling liquorish delight,

Men and women gaily dight at midnight 
	to enmesh,

Dreaming, - screaming 
Whispering wistfully a bitter sort of 
	love.
