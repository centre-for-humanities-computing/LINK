THANK GOD!

Thank God, I'm not a gentleman,
	That I feel free to swear and shout, 
That I can sometimes lose my head 
	And not know what I am about.

Thank God, I have no double way 
	That I can put on like a suit - 
One for the women who obey 
	The Code, one for the Prostitute.

Yes, thank God, I've no little code,
	 No paltry ethics of a clan,
No proper and well-beaten road -  
	Thank God, I'm not a gentleman!
