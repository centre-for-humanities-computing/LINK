TO A SOAP-BOX ORATOR

How can we hate enough to fight?
How can we think enough to win?
It is a reeling summer night,
And you, young man in the street-lamp's glare,
Tell us the world and all's our share. . .
You might as well talk of eternal sin!
What does it matter? What do we care?. . . 
With noises and smells all soaking in,
And the pressing crowds and beckoning eyes. . .
Your words come hot and urgent and wise,
But . . . it's Saturday night - and a dime to spare!
