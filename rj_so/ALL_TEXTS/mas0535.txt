TWO CONTENTMENTS

The curtain falls between the world and me, 
	My lamp burns bright and the oil is far unspent.
No noises reach me from the land or sea -  
	I am content.

Far runs the road ahead and calls to me.
	Gladly my heart, unwearied, forth is bent. 
In freedom sharing as the sun is free - 
	I am content.
