ISHMAEL

Again the wanderer starts out 
	To alien battles; and we see, 
Beneath the welter and the rout, 
	The ancient, tragic irony.

He goes, too dumbly to be grim, 
	Down to the dead, the chosen ones;
While nations that rejected him 
	Accept his flesh to stop the guns.

Plunged in a war he never sought, 
	Hurled at his brothers' gaping lines;
Blinded, bewildered, scattered, caught -  
	A sudden ray of promise shines. . . .

He stops - the guerdon seems too great!
	Then, with a deep and trembling breath, 
He goes to meet a thundering fate
	And die, perhaps, a captain's death!

Pariah, outcast - he delights 
	In struggles that should drive him mad.
He lives upon defeat; and fights 
	To save a home he never had.
