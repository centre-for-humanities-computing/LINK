THE SNOB

He said not even nothing very well.
	After you spoke he reached, and slammed a door 
Within his mind . . . and ponderous silence fell. 
	There were few things his sneer could not ignore.

His talk was obvious and trite enough.
	None missed it then, and no one ever will. 
But it must puzzle God to "call his bluff" -
	That horrible, complacent "keeping still"!
