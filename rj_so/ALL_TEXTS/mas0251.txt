THIS IS THE SIN

Not for the sudden slaying, nor the white brows
	wet with pain,
 Not for the living flesh that rots, hoping relief in vain; 
Not for the weary waiting, the sad, interminable 
	days,
Not for the hours of anguish after the shock and 
	amaze,
Not for weeping children that huddle in hapless
	groups,
Not for the rapine and slaughter before victorious
	 troops;
Not for these woes I indict thee, though these are 
	caught in thy mesh, -  
Not merely these, O Great War, for these are but woes
	of the flesh!

Gladly men die for their country, gladly they suffer 
	pain, - 
What is the hurt of the body, if truly the spirit gain? 
But for the eyes that harden, the hearts that fill with 
	hate
And for the fears of dastard souls that dare not face 
	their fate!
For silly tales of angels upon the field of Mons 
And seraphim in hospitals with sen-sen and bon-bons! 
For partisans and bigots, for harness so hard to 
	cast, - 
(And all the ancient masters arising to make it fast),
For writing the words "my country" where "mybrother" should have been; 
For bringing the old suspicions into the hearts of men; 
For hoarding of bitter grudges, for marking of deadly
	scores,
For these, indeed, I indict thee, greatest of bloody 
	wars!
If thou hadst but injured the body, thou hadst taken a
	 heavy toll,
But how shall we requite thee when thou hast hurt the 
	soul?
