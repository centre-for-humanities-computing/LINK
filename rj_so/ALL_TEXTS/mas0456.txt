THE DEAD HORSE

Rotting it lay beneath the affable skies; 
	A fecund carrion thrusting to the air 
	Its powerful benediction. Everywhere 
About it sang a cloud of bright, green flies. 
Joyfully strengthened birds began to rise; 
	Great, shining beetles ran, refreshed and fair, 
	And countless crawling things swarmed 
		gladly there; 
Called by the death that feeds and fortifies.

So, laughing to that lively world he came: 
	Death, like a lover at some glorious task, 
		Transformed and quickened by this grea-
			ter strife.
His dark disguise could not conceal the flame; 
	For there, behind his ineffectual mask,
		Sparkled the fresh and conquering eyes of 
			Life.
