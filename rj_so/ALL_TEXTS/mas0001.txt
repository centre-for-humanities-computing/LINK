WHO CAN BLAME?

When the mills of men have ground us 
	To the fighting edge of fate.Who can blame if lying around us 
	Is the wreckage of blind hate?When for dollars we are broken	Like a fagot for a fire. 
Who can blame if by that token	We inflame in razing ire?When with being slave and chattel 
	For a pittance we have done,Who can blame if we give battle? 
	We are many, they are one!
