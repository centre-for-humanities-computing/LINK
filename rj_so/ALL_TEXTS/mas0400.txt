NEEDLE TRAVEL

I sit at home and sew,
I ply my needle and thread, 
But the trip around the garment's hem 
Is not the path I tread; 
My stitches neat, 
With their rhythmic beat, 
Keep time to very different feet, 
On a different journey sped.

Now, glad heart
Tip-toe, tip-toe,
They must not hear you,
They must not know,
They must not follow where you go.

Bare, brown feet on the dusty road, 
Unbound body free of its load,
Limbs that need no stinging goad 
Step, step out on the dusty road.

Friends to greet on the jolly road,
Lopeing rabbit, and squatting toad,
Beetle, trundling along with your load;
Hey, little friends,
Good-day, good-morrow,
You see me to-day,
You forget me to-morrow.

Time to chase you across the road,
 Lopeing rabbit, and poke you, toad, 
Upset you, beetle with your load; 
Hey, little friends, 
Good-day.

Bare, brown feet in the shelving pool,
Unbound body, relaxed and cool,
Limbs lying bare and beautiful
Hey, green pool,
Good-day, good-morrow,
You hold me to-day,
You forget me to-morrow

.Time to float in you, rapt and cool, 
Swim the rapids above you, pool, 
Dive in your waters bountiful; 
Hey, sweet friend, 
Good-day.

I sit at home and sew,
I ply my needle and thread,
But the trip around the garment's hem
Is not the path I tread.
