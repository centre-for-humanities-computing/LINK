SONYA

What made your little, wizened face so kind,
And made me happy just to look at you;
 And see your small and crooked-seeming body 
Bend over household tasks or sewing 
In that skilled way you had? 
And what made the long-rebelling thought 
Assail me, when your high, shrill voice 
Pierced me in distant rooms, and I could hear you 
Pouring love-words on my only child?

I knew your human need, your tender heart, 
And took your lavish service and your love 
With almost shame.
		And you have gone, 
Passed with fierce loyalty to another home, 
And squander mother-love on strangers' children 
For twenty-seven dollars every month.
