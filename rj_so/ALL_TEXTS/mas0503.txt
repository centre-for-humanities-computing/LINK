TO MACDOWELL

Oh, I would love to be mad 
	With the madness of beauty! Be 
Engulfed in a tempest of wonder
	As froth on a turbulent sea! 
A blanching of foam on a mountainous
	Surge of resplendent unrest, 
A wisp of white foam on the passionate 
	Green of the ocean's breast!

Thus was it mot that you found it,
	Maker of beautiful song? 
Say, was it wonderful? . Give me
	Word of the sea. of the throng 
Of the lash of the wind laid upon you,
	The heave of the billows of lust, 
Ere I wither away in the sun,
	Smother and die in the dust! 

Tell of the green "bolt's shriek  
	In the savage blackness above, 
And the staggering toss of the terrible
	Wave of imperious love! 
Tell of the hate that sweeps
	In an insolent red typhoon 
Of a feverish sea that seethes
	In the clasp of an haggard moon!

Would I were there in the marvellous
	Tumult of wind and of wave, 
Mad as a violet ghost
	In the violent gale of the grave! 
Flung with a wild desire
	Out of the trough of despair 
To the crest of an amorous rage,
	And the hands of the, wind in my 
		hair!

There, when the wind should abate 
	And the vasty billows decrease 
And the scurrying wind-whipped venery
	Over the sea should cease, 
Soft on the undulous ease
	Of the glimmering noon-day ocean, 
Blind with desire I'd be,
	Drunk 'with the white emotion.

Tell me of strange wild things,
	You who have felt them urging - 
Madness of beautiful winds.
	Storm wrought billows upsurging! 
For I choke in the dust, 
	Shudder and wither away, 
Sane, with a practical life, 
	Yoked to a routine day.
