A WAITER

The long and weary day I stand and wait -  
And all the evening to the midnight hour: 
The men are gay, the women beautiful; 
They eat the food I dare but only smell, 
And drink the wines I may not hope to taste; 
They move an eyelash or a haughty brow,
 Or lift a finger or a raucous voice, 
And I obey and give them what they will. 
They drink and eat, and talk their empty talk 
While I, pale, weary, statue-like and dumb, 
Stand waiting.

I stand and wait, and ponder as I wait:For you the leisure and the wine of life;For you the glory and the fruit of love.For us the bondage and the bitter leas!For us the venom of our love's despair!And you - you fancy we shall long endure?No! not forever shall we .... Yes, sir; wine?Port, sir? - yes, sir! .... I am pale and dumb:They chatter on; nor ever dream that weAre thinking - yes, and waiting for a time ....Just waiting.
