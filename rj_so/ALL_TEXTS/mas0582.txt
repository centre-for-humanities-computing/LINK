THE COOLIE SHIP

Across the huddled forms each 
	wrapped in its blanket. 
Lying in the dim light drifted with the 
	smoke 
Of opium, fetid with close-packed life, 
Sound the broken notes of the crude 
	little flute. 
The waves strike the ship which rocks 
	and tosses; 
The weary figures are torpid, each be-
	side its bundle; 
The stars swing and sway as though 
	fastened to strings; 
The tired engines gasp and strain 
	against the sea - 
They beat quick and uneven like the 
	heart of a dying man. 
Across the troubled decks, losing itself 
	in the vast reaches of sky and sea, 
The Chinese flute, breathes its broken 
	song into the night.
