RED CROSS

The women sit at long white tables, 
Clad in straight white aprons 
Like shrouds;
Snipping and folding and stitching all 
	day
That each small unit of their work 
May be quite perfect.

What are they thinking of, these women 
Bent so intently on their work? 
Perhaps the mothers are thinking of
	their sons 
Who may need a woman's care, 
And the young girls are thinking, may
	be,
Of their proud young sweethearts 
Full of unthinking eagerness for war. 
Or perhaps they are only thinking 
How they must make their work quite 
	perfect
So that the women of the Baptist Church 
May see and envy
The patriotic zeal of the Presbyterians.
