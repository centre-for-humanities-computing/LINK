BROTHER OF POETS

I am a writer.                
But I do not write for a living -  
I work in a factory. 
A blood-red mill where men tear their
	 muscles 
At the scream of the foreman, 
A mill where they grind out the hearts 
	and the souls of men. 
I am an immigrant, the son of peasants. 
I have no polite learning, that knows a 
	little of many things. 
But I have the mind and the soul of a 
	poet. 
I have the Divine Spark. 
There is that in me which says to write. 
I go home at night blackened from the
	fire of the furnaces. 
I sit at the table with the red cloth on 
	it, 
I seize my pen to write of the beauty 
	within me -  
But I fall asleep with my head on the 
	table. 
Sometimes I rise early in the morning 
	to write. I
 thrill with the wonder that is in me.
Then I remember that coal has raised 
	two dollars a ton,  
That we must have flour and the little 
	ones shoes -  
My wife is thin because she does not 
	have enough to eat. 
I earn ten dollars at the mill, 
That is not enough to buy coal and 
	flour and shoes.                
I wonder what I am going to do. 
I pick up my pen, but the beautiful 
	thought has left me.                
My mind is as barren as my purse. 
I take up my lunch of bread and cheese 
	and go off to the mill. 
If I stop to think of the beautiful thing 
	I forgot 
The foreman swears at me.               
I think I shall never get it written.               

I read of a rich man who paid thous-
	ands of dollars for a picture. 
The artist was dead. 

I do not care for money,               
But I wish I could write that beautiful 
	thing before I die.
