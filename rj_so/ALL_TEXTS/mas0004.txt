THE MILLS OF THE RICH

We ask that they work for a while as		we work, 
	On a wage that is hunger and pain; 
We ask that they give us the bread that		is ours,	The rich, who grow strong on our
		 gain:We are women who toil with burden 
		of men,	But with courage that makes for the 
		strength.Our children are born to the curse of 
		the poor;No power to rise, but the lot to en-
		dure,	And the depth of our life is its length!

We ask for the half-loaf of labor. 
	As our hands and our souls are 
		scarred;For the mills of the gods grind slowly, 
	But the mills of the rich grind hard.

We seek but the chance to live humbly 
		with toil,	On a wage that will pay for our 
		needs;We ask not the ease that is unearned 
		and left	From the brains of our forefathers' 
		needs.The balance of life, that is, justice and 
		right,	Throws our fate to the world, at its 
		best.Oh, God! we are sick, with no heart		for the cure; 
Teach man, in Thy mercy, we cannot		endure - 	We are poor, we are poor and op-
		pressed.We fight for the half-loaf of labor, 
	As the dregs and the crumbs are 
		charredWith lire of souls, and are bitter; 
	And the mills of the rich grind hard.
