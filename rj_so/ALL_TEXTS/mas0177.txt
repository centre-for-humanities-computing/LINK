"THE NEW FREEDOM" FOR WOMEN

Some call him the "greatest pres-
	ident since Lincoln." 
Lincoln - that sombre-eyed giant of the 
	people:Who sealed with the life-blood of his	great heart 
The freedom of the weak, the helpless! 
Today, when the mother of men 
(Whipped by hunger 
To the rattling loom -  
The shrieking maker of seams.) 
Grows faint, weary of the barrenness	of life, 
Sells her body to feed it... 
"Where is the Lincoln to free her - 
To strengthen her arm for the battle?

Only a man from the South, 
With a passion for freedom so reck-
	less, so wild, 
That he calls to the valiant dead, 
To the living grown old in its service - 
To the ardent, the eager and young: 
"You can afford a little while to wait."
