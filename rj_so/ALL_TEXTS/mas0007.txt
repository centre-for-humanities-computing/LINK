HOBBLEDEHOY

Hobbledehoy, neither man nor boy,With a burden ot pain and a purpose of joy,
With a heart and a hunger of God's alloy, 
He's a lad whom the jungle and heaven decoy. T
here's God and the Devil in Hobbledehoy!What shall we do when Hobbledehoy, 
With zest of a beast to possess or destroy, 
Is tripped in his track for the hunting of joy? 
What shall we do when the beast in the boy 
Calls out to the devil in Hobbledehoy?Shall we punish the nature ot Hobbledehoy, 
Cage and encourage it forth to destroy? -  
Or quicken the pain in him, quicken the joy, -  
The pang of the birth of the man from the boy! -  
Shall we give him the Devil? Hobbledehoy?
