OH, LITTLE MOONLIT HILL

We two shall wander up a moonlit hill, 
	You and I,
And lamps of town grow dim and golden, warm, 
And sounds of city traffic, muffled, low,
 Shall thrum a crooning song, and in our hearts 
	A love-song, too.

And we shall lie where scents of grass are sweet, 
	You and I,
And where the night-sky creeps upon our souls 
And smothers us with passion-tinted hands
 And bends us close - oh, little moonlit hill, 
	And you and I
