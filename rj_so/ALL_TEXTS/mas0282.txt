APRIL SCENT

Longing, and restlessness, and discontent - 
	Three winds from out of Eden, blowing low 
The tender, unforgotten April-scent
	Of blossoms that in Eden-gardens grow.
	Blossoms more radiant than the earthy know - 
Blossoms whose first faint flush is never spent;
	Sweet winds from out of Eden, blowing low
	Longing, and restlessness, and discontent.
