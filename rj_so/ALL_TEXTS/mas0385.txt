RAVENS

Sand dunes - 	And beyond them,wet and dismal 
With spoiled fresh water seeping, out of	the blown sand 
From the springs it has smothered, 
Like blood from a murderer's iron-
	bound trunk, 
Lies the bare low-tide beach. 
Fifteen miles to the Cape southward, 
Three to the Rocks northward, 
Reaches the view. 
Not a living thing is in sight 
Save a swarm of little dark mites, the	sandpipers, 
Infesting the soft wet sand of the
	 beach,And yonder five ravens, 
Looking as if they wore misfit ready-
	made professional black, 
But knowing, 
Cynical,Having no illusions.Long ago wise to the foul side of life,Waddle distrustfully from some dead	thing as I approach, 
Reluctantly suspending their inquest. 
How lonely it all is! Why can't we have a war here, too? 
These stagnant, antediluvian reaches of	coast 
Might be alive with men digging	trenchesAnd killing each other, night and day, 
Just as it goes in Belgium.

Old as our ravens are,We might teach them something!
