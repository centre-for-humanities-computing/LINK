LOVE NEED HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO

Love need have nothing else to do, 
And joy may laugh the whole day 
	thru,
Grief has its tears and sighs, not less -  
But, where's the help for emptiness?

Spring rushes in with all its light, 
Grief grieves the more and clings to 
	night,
Joy must laugh and love caress - 
But how can spring stir emptiness?
