A BREATH OF LIFE

Yes, he'll enlist - he'll leap at the chance!

If you think eleven servile hours a day', six days a week, 
A slatternly wife, a tableful of children all mouths,A sodden Sunday, and then the long round again,Can bind him to sanity and peace,You do not know your brother - You do not know yourself!

Better the close-locked inarching feet, 
The music like great laughter, the rough comradeships - 
War is a picnic, a vast game of chance; 
You may win, - or earn a quick and bursting death, 
Cancelling all these unpaid duty-debts at home.

Then - on to the picnic !Out of the foul-aired routine!A breath of life, tho death be the price!
