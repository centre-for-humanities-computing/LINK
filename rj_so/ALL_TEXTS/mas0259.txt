SONNET

Heart-Happy, splendidly awake 
	and smiling; 
Leaning with laughter, ripe with	thoughts to speak, 
But not yet gathered; ever there to 
	seekAnd see, but only seen in dreamful 
	whiling!

Heart-happy, lightly on tiptoe, beguil-
	ingMy fancy out of faith by seeming 
	meekIn substance, shadow - cast and 
	shadow-bleak, 
Yet smiling, splendidly awake and smil-
	ing!

O could I gather you, ripe unto drop-
	ping,Shake laughter from you, and ripe 
	fruit of smile;And pluck rich thoughts unspoken; 
	could I pile 
All in my heart forever, never stop-
	ping - 

I could awake and smile and lean	with laughter, 
Fling fancy off and cast its shadow	after.
