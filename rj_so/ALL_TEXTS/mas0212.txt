PAGLIACCO

We work knee-deep
In our graves 
Down the shadow-sunken alley of the
	years - 
To-day - to-morrow - forever! 
he listening heart is plundered 
By the murderous macabre of shop ma-
	chines 
Iron-throated Carusoes 
Gurgling and groaning and grinding 
The eternal aria: 
Clown! Fool! 
Pagliacci!!! Pagliacci!!! 
And we must listen 
To-dayâ€š - to-morrow - forever -  
And we must hang 
Like broken Christs on Calvary 
When those sounds
Bombard and batter -  
And Bound and Break 
Upon the heart -  
And bleed out 
Their eternal aria: 
Fool! Clown! 
Pagliacci!!! Pagliacci!!! 
To-day - 
There floats in through the grated win-
`dows 
A music - 
As if from the lips of lilies
Before they died - 
We who had been working
Knee-deep in our graves
Flocked to the window - 
An Italian funeral faltered by - 
We stood awhile
Forgetting our own graves - 
Drinking in the music
That floated from the lips of delicate
	flowers 
The foreman bellowed in
Angered and flushed -  
The foreman who guards 
Our half erected tombs - 
We skulked back to our work 
We skulked back to our graves 
And once - more those Iron-throated
	Carusoes
Are groaning and gurgling and grinding 
Their eternal aria:
Clown!! Fool!! 
Pagliacci!!! Pagliacci!!!
