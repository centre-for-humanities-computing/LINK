EXIT SALVATORE

Salvatore's dead - a gap	Where he worked in the ditch-edge, shoveling mud;
Slanting brow; a head mayhap	Rather small, like a bullet; hot southern blood; 
Surly now, now riotous	With the flow of his joy; and his hovel bare, 
As his whole life is to us - 	A stone in his belly the whole of his share.

Body starved, but the soul secure,	Masses to save it from Purgatory, 
And to dwell with the Son and Virgin pure - 
		Lucky Salvatore!

Salvatore's glad, for see	On the hearse and the coffin, purple and black, 
Tassels, ribbons, 'broidery,	Fit for the Priest's or the Pope's own back; 
Flowers costly, waxen, gay,	And the mates from the ditch-edge, pair after pair;Dirging band, and the Priest to pray,	And the soul of the dead one pleasuring there.

Body starved, and the mind as well.	Peace - let him rot in his costly glory. 
Cheated no more with a Heaven or Hell - 
		Exit Salvatore.
