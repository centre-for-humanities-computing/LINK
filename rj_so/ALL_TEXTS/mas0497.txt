TO A SCHOOLMISTRESS

		I
Are you so sure: - you with the
	weary eyes 
And lips grown bitter nursing a hungry 
	heart - 
To urge with sneers, the vilest female 
	art, 
Your boys into the shambles - is it wise? 
Grant him a hero who for country dies, 
And with full knowledge chooses such 
	a part
He may face smilingly the Reaper's  
	dart - 
Mere boys cannot prepare that sacrifice.
Ah, you, who never knew the pangs of 
	birth 
Nor those long patient years of mother-
	hood;
When these lithe bodies clutch the red-
	dening earth,
Guts hanging out, breasts torn, the clot-
	ting blood - 
Are you so sure it was pro patria,
Not covetous anger of a hungry heart?

		II
Childless and heartsick, weary, 
	you and I 
Have tasted life and found it bitter woe 
And disillusion; fain are we to go. 
In any cause how gladly would we die 
Had we the courage‚Äîwe whom Life 
	flung by 
Unworthy better service, fit to sew 
Patches, upon Youth's garments. Ah, I
	know 
How much you envy those who are to
	die - 
With strong hearts beating high and the 
	acclaim
Of a whole nation ringing in their ears, 
We with sick bodies covetous of fame 
Have missed by weakly yielding to our  
	fears. 
What, - shall we send to slaughter any
	man 
Who have not borne one, no, nor ever can?
