ALMOST

My sweetheart has the supplest arms 
	So full of tenderness and fire; 
They almost cheat her other charms 
	They way they rouse and still desire.

My sweetheart has the kindest breast,
	Two heavens with each a single star; 
They give me everything but rest - 
	So strange these rosy pillows are.

My sweetheart has the hungriest lips
	That beg and press unsparingly; 
They cling so close she almost slips
	Among her kisses into me.

My sweetheart's body is a cry,
	A poignant and resistless call; 
It almost makes me wonder why
	She hasn't any mind at all.
