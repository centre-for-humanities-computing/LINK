ENCHANTMENT

I know a place where tall rushes 
	grow
Knee deep in soft black loam, 
And where the white kiss of the rising 
	mist
Softens the long brown dunes
Which are so eternally wooed
By the passionate sea
With her foam white breasts laid bare.

And beyond this place where my rushes 
	are,
Is a church-like forest of priestly pines,
Deep cushioned with a cool green moss
Which gives to hot and tired bodies
Rest, forgetfulness.
And for your canopy the stars
And for your candle light the moon.

And all this must be a secret,
Because of dimming memories 
Which are not mine alone. 
But tell me - 
Is it not wonderful to know
That somewhere just beyond this seeth-
	ing town 
Such deep enchantment lies?
