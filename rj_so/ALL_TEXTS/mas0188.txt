BUGLE SONG

	In the cold, wet, and moaning night, 
	I left my home, its warmth, its light,
To pace alone through many a dark and silent street; 
	The old, cold, blood of many kings long dead, 
	The heavy lips of many souls, long fled,
Seemed pressing down upon me like a winding-sheet.

	I left my home, its warmth, its light,
	Its half-read tale of ancient fight, 
The battle's blows, its shock, its tumult in my brain,
	All quenched at leaving, like a wind-blown lamp,
	And the night wrapped me in its mantle damp,
 And mourned about me with its cold and fitful rain.

	But the dawn's breath sang keener songs 
	Of battle with Tomorrow's wrongs,
 And the wild north wind stung my cheek until it 
		burned,
	As though to wake me with its minstrelsy 
	Of deeds and blood-wrought justice yet to be, - 
And fresher air with the unconquered morn returned!
