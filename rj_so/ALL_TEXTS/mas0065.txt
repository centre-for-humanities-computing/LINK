GAROTTE

Let it come now! O God, Thou nearest us groanDeep in our dungeons, who were never free - The Samsons that, through earth's eternity,Paid for their masters' ease with blood and bone;If, at the last, our lords will not atone,If, at the last, they rob us of our fee,If, at the last, the worst we dread must be:If Right must strangle Wrong to win her own - Then, hear me 'mid Thy swirling systems, Thou:By whatsoever pity we have won,By ail our tyrants' crimes beneath the sun,I beg Thee this one mighty boon allow:In mine own time let that high deed be done;Let it come now, my God, - let it come now!
