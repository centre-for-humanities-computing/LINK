A PRAYER

To that true god I call myself,
	Whose form lay huddled in the earliest womb of fiery mist;W
ho slowly groped to life through the long and bloody
	 generations,
Maker of all the gods, as childish playthings of joy 
	and terror;
Retirer of all the gods, save himself, when he stood 
	towering,
Shining up to man's estate and man's affairs:

God, in high loneliness apart I talk with you -  
Give me always this precious communion.

Give me strength to fling aside the false gods,
Even to the last of them - 
The childish toys of the race;
The fear-spurring ghosts; the faltering beliefs.

Give me the vaster strength to see and build for myself
Man's business, and man's customs.
Keep me from the chains of ownership,
From cellaring myself in a comfortable litter of books
	and pictures, clothes and possessions, 
That drain my soul from my larger work.

Keep me from too-great love - 
Love of father, that makes me but an echo of a dying 
	hero;
Love of mother, that clips my wings and manacles me
	to the prison of the past;
Love of woman, that bids me grow, flesh into flesh and
	soul into soul, 
Until we sink, strangled in the embrace; 
Love of friend, that plants my foot in the footsteps
	before me, 
Shunning the rougher, straighter path.

Give me great love of myself - 
Love that will whip me to unfold my full flowering
In the blighted gardens of men.

Keep me from dream-ridden indolence, 
That softens the sinews of my spirit.

Send me forth, adventuring,
From the quick-mud of the gutter
To the clasp of the thin golden fingers of the stars.

Let me will life,
And its hearty, freshening struggles.

And when the small word comes to me that the end of
	this road is near, 
God, do not let me flee my certain end; 
Let me will death. . . . 
Gladly, with clear vision, as a conqueror, 
Let me serenely pass on the light to loftier gods, 
And go forth to farther roads,
Knowing that death will come when I will have it 
	come.
