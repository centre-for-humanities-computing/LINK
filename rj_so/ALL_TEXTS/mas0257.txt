RITUAL

Why should I come to be baptized 
	to you, O Church, I that am 
	cleansed and freshened day by day 
	in the primordial mystery of 
	waters?

God forbid that I should break my daily 
	bread - essence of all green wheat-
	fields - unmindful that His body lies 
	in the palm of my hands (and 
	ground and broken for my sake!)

Or taste of morning's milk and not be 
	made partaker of the Soul of all 
	the world, - sweet outflow of the 
	mighty breasts to creatures newly-
	born?

Ripe golden fruit - butter and honey - 
	eggs - shall I feed on these things
	. . . all unaware . . .?

Say, what have you to offer me,
	Church, with sacrament and holy 
	day?

Show me first the day which is NOT 
	holy; food which is NOT the body 
	of the Lord!
