VENUS AND MARS

Venu and Mars looked from the cloudless blue, 
	Down on the bloody and disordered field
Where buzzards, surfeited and heavy, flew.â€š
	"See, Love,"said Mars, "this is my choicest yield.

"And I need men. The farmer when he fears 
	The pinch of famine, more abundant sows.
I pray you dry the women's flood of tears 
	And make love blossom in them like a rose.

"Lure each, though weeping, to embrace a man
	No matter who, so that his strength be good.
Breed for my banquets, 'tis a goodly plan:
	For when I drink I drain the best of blood."

"My lord, my warrior," smiling Venus said,
	"I will seduce them to your high behest;
And though the father lie among the dead,
	His son shall wait for you beneath the breast."
