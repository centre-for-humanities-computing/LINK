DELIVERANCE

Just think of me -  
Come from the shadows of the womb 
To the shadows of this world; 
Seeing the sun only through a veil. 
On both sides of me walk ghostly shapes; 
One on either hand.

Often on a Spring afternoon,
Being misled by the bright glow beyond the hills,
I would run with all the strength and fleetness of my
	youth 
Up the long slope!
Hearing only my heart-beats and the rushing of the 
	wind.
I stood on the summit and hallooed at freedom.
I was glad, thinking I had outrun my gray companions;
Glad for one moment - 
But as the glow died in my cheeks and in my heart 
I heard again the evil footfalls, measured and slow. 
And I knew they were still abreast of me. . . .

Then, on a glad May morning I thought I met the Sun. 
I had always wished to look him in the face; to see 
	him without his veil.
And, in that dazzling moment, I tnought: "At last, the 
	Sun!"
Such a light and gladness was in that face, 
Such a rush of living love. 
It was not the Sun. 
It was my lover. 
I mated with him.
He made me such a bright palace of words that I
	thought I could live in it. 
I told him of the shadows and of the veil before the
	face of the Sun; 
But he said he had a Magic that would slay my grim
	companions.
And that it was not the Sun that was veiled, but my 
	eyes;
And that he could tear those veils away . . . 
So in the days that followed I lay in a bright dream. 
At times I waked for an instant, but then I felt the 
	dread presences always with me.

So back into the dream. . . .
And from that dream, half ecstasy, half pain,
Came our child.
And I was glad.
"Now," I said, as I watched him grow like a flame, 
"Here is a fire to burn away mist -  
And here is a golden sword to slay an army of
	shadows!" 
And I waited for the miracle.

But the flame danced like a wind-blown butterfly; 
And the sword made only a happy clatter; 
A game in a nursery. . . .
And the black mist rose and wrapped itself over all
	brightness - 
It blotted out the sun, 
And lay over the gay colors of flowers, 
It hung on the lips of laughter like a sneer. . . . 
And the dark guests stayed on -  
They put an evil sound into the gentle fall of snow; 
They crept into the wind and made it a menace. 
They pressed dully against me - even in the hour of 
	love. . . .

Whence will come the cleansing flame -  
Must it be the fire of my own heart? 
And the sword of deliverance -  
Must it be made with my own hands?
