THE EMOTIONALIST

He annoys me; for why does he float
On such false golden cloud, 
Or splash through such cisterns of tears? 
He's so fond of a "lump in his throat."
 "It's got me, my boy!" is the language he uses; 
Eternally gapes with the crowd, 
And vibrates to their joys and their fears.

One minute he hates you; the next, 
With tears in his eyes, 
He wrings off your hand. He's as frank 
As a child that is jolly or vexed.
Most times there's the whiff of a drink or so round 
	him.
He doesn't "pretend to be wise.
"He's a "business man - known at the bank."

He is slapped on the back by the "boys."
"Well, what's the good word!"
Life's a snorting bad broncho he rides,
Yet a riotous romp he enjoys.
Good actors and orators stir him to thunderous
Feeling applause. He is stirred
By "raw life" in tumultuous tides.

Histrionics he shows - and yet all
Of his nature, not part,
And his slow, elephantine finesse
And his rapid mood-changes enthrall;
So I miss him when gone, for I can't tell just how
But the fellow creeps into one's heart
As the symbol of generousness.

It's true. After all, life to him
Is brand-new every day.
To feel things, not stopping to think;
On the high seas of drama to swim;
Experience sensations - well, that's all of life,
As an artist might say.
So he gulps life down quick, like his drink!
