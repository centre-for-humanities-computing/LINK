ROCKAWAY BEACH

The dance pavilion stains the night
With a white blotch of hazy light, 
And, pairing black motes, to and fro, 
Two by two the dancers go, 
While winds make faint or loud-convey 
The echoes of the orchestra.
 Without, the vast mysterious tide 
Murmurs, night-haunted, far and wide. 
Whence have ye gained the soul to dance 
With such light-moving elegance 
'Mid all this menace of the dark, 
Ye motes who throng life's tiny spark? 
Why are we brave, my fellowkind? 
Are we gods, or are we blind?
