LINES TO A POMERANIAN PUPPY VALUED AT $3,500

Often as I strain and stew,
	Digging in these dirty ditches, 
I have dared to think of you -  
	You and all your riches.

Lackeys help you on and off;
	And the bed is silk you lie in; 
You have doctors when you cough,
	Priests when you are dying.

Wrapt in soft and costly furs, 
	All sewed up with careful stitches,
You consort with proper curs 
	And with perfumed bitches.

At your lightest, wheezy bark
	Haughty women run to feed you - 
Deaf to all things else, they hark 
	And, what's more, they heed you.

Guarded from the world, you grow 
	Sleek and snug in pillowed niches;
You will never have to know 
	Common ills or itches.

Lord, but things are queer and odd -  
	Queerer still with you to show it;
You're a lucky dog, by God -  
	And you do not know it!

You don't sweat to struggle free, 
	Work in rags and rotting breeches - 
Puppy, have a laugh at me 
	Digging in the ditches.
