COMPARISON

How long, and slim, and straight thou liest beside me! 
Thy body is like the shaft of a strong pillar, 
Or brawny tree-trunk; firm and round and hard.

Often thy fancy has likened me to a flower:
A tree art thou; so tall aloft, so rugged,
With branches proud, and roots that never swerve.

How frail I look next thee, and foolish fashioned!
And yet, I think I like my own self better: 
What has thy body lovely as my breasts?

O thou art also beautiful, beloved; 
Only I still do find thee unfamiliar: 
Different from me: so strong, so strange - 

So strange, my eyes will scarcely dare behold thee; 
My hands draw back when they would reach to touch 
	thee;
But for thy kisses I were half afraid.
