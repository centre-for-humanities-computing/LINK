RAINY SONG

Down the dripping pathway dancing through the rain
Brown eyes of beauty, laugh to me again!

Eyes full of starlight, moist over fire, 
Full of young wonder, touch my desire!

O like a brown bird, like a bird's flight, 
Run through the rain drops lithely and light.

Body like a gypsy, like a wild queen,
Slim brown dress to slip through the green - 

The little leaves hold you as soft as a child,
The little path loves you, the path that runs wild.

Who would not love you, seeing you move, 
Warm-eyed and beautiful through the green grove?

Let the rain kiss you, trickle through your hair, 
Laugh if my fingers mingle with it there,

Laugh if my cheek too is misty and drips -  
Wetness is tender - laugh on my lips

The happy sweet laughter of love without pain, 
Young love, the strong love, burning in the rain.
