SHELLS

Thousands of shells washed up on the beach - 
	Exquisite empty forms . . . 
Here a few (shining ones) for the children of the 
	race to play with . . . delightedly . . . 
	for a time;
There a few to swell the vast collection. . . 
	endlessly preserved;
But nearly all to crumble into sand - the great up-
	bearing sand - 
And never a one to house again the soft little life of 
	the shell-builder.
