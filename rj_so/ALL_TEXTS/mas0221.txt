SIC VOS NO VOBIS

Steel-sinewed toiler, rearing these the
	frame
Of vast resorts where Joy sets by her
	 store,Whence art thou come, what thy un-
	titled name, 
And canst thou enter zvhen the task 
	is o'er?Think on thy destiny. Is this the aim 
	Of all thy days? Must thou forever 
		buildThat others may invade thy sacred 
	claim?And is thy just beseeching to be 
	stilledBy vampire hordes who glut upon thy 
	toil?Their voice is sweet, not so the song 
	they sing,Yet art thou wound within their flatter-
	ing coil,Till thy brief hour of life hath taken 
	wing.They bound thy hands, in blood, to 
	slavery.Fling off the chains: in bloodless strife 
	stand free!
