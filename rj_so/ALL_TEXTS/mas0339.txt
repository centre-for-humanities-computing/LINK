THE "L" EXPRESS

Rackety - rackety - ziz - ziz - rack, 
The cars of the Elevated clack along the track. 
With a jerk and a whirr and a devil-may-care, 
Along we go racketing, up in the air.

Garbage in the alleys bursts its dirty cans, 
Backyard washing gets the dust a quick breeze fans, 
Slattern women gossip on a rickety stair - 
Grime and ugly living and a stale despair!

Rackety - rackety - ziz - ziz - rack,
Back and forth and back again, we clack along the track. 
Why are we journeying, and where, where, where? 
Hurry! hurry! hurry! we've no time to care!
