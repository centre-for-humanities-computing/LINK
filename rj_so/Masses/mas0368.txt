AN EAST-SIDE SWEAT-BATH

Glistening, sweating bodies, 
Open-mouthed gasping. The 
	steamCaressing the skin with a warm moist
	 hand.Stooped over, heads lower than the 
	shoulders,Turning buckets of cold water 
Over felt-capped hats.The strong smell of cheap soap,The thrashing of laurel brooms,The lusty whacks of the "rubbers"On the bare backs, 
The cracking of bones of the spine and 
	the shoulder.
The "Hoo-hai" of the newcomer 
Into the sweat room.The constant hissing of the steam,The dim electric bulb,The tiers of sodden wooden benches, 
The continual splashing and dripping of 
	water,And then out again, bare, nude, clean 
	bodies,Wrapped in white sheets.The chatting on the couches,The stories with the spice of sex,The loud laughter, the smacking of lips 
Over lunches of herring and brown 
	bread,The sleepers snoring and groaning,The smell of clean bodies,Cheap soap and herring.
