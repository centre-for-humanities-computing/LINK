THE WOMAN REBEL

At last a voice that knew not how to lie, 
	A call articulate above the throng 
Of those who whispered of a secret wrong, 
And longed for liberty and passed it by. 
The voice of one with rebel head held high, 
	Whose strength was not the fury of the strong, 
	But whose clear message was more keen than song, 
A bugle to the dawn, a battle cry.

There is a new rebellion on the earth
	Because of your voice militant, that broke 
The silence which the puritans had made; 
Because you hailed the sacredness of birth, 
	The dignity of love emancipate, and spoke, 
A woman unto women, unafrid.
