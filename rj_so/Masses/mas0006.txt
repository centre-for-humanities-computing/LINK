WOMAN'S PLACE

Suffragette, suffragette, why do you roam?Women are wisest in staying at home: 
A few foolish millions may slave for their bread: 
Perversely preferring to work and be fed:

But suffragette, suffragette, why do you roam? 
Babies are needing you back in the home: 
They frisk to the factory, romp to the shop; 
Naughty young toilers! Persuade them to stop:Suffragette, suffragette, why do you roam? 
Mother is scrubbing at somebody's home; - 
A singular choice, that of work by the day; 
What are we coming to, suffragette, say?
