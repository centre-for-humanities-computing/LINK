THE SLEEPERS

Moonlight and music and the sound of waves
Reached out and held us there, 
Each close to each,
Upon the night-blurred and deserted beach.
She sang an old, imperishable air
Softly . . . and from forgotten graves
A mist of memories arose 
As if in answer to an unspoken call.
A soft and intimate breeze
Blew over us and over all
The blue and faintly-singing spaces;
Over the quiet and the salty balm
,Over the velvet skies and seas,
Over our half-concealed and cloudy faces.
That strange and rosy wind
Mellowed the distance, smoothing down the thinned,
Sharp edges of the sickle-moon,
Bringing the night so close
That, when our fingers clasped,
We grasped and held its greatness and calm
Warmly within each palm.

And, as her head sank back, 
And the breath of the night came slower, 
A drowsy voice grew out of the black 
As her own voice sank lower.
Something caught her unspoken word. 
It answered and mingled with her; 
Their breath blended and I heard 
The voice of Sleep and her sleepy voice 
Singing together. . .

The wind crept up on the sands and stopped; 
The voices dropped.
Our fingers loosened; the night imposed 
The weight of all sleepers upon us and closed 
Our heavy eyes. . . .

Then, as we lay,
I stretched my hand into the skies
And plunged it through that shining spray;
Pushing aside the cloudy bars, 
And grasped the moon like a scythe;
And cut down great, wide swathes of stars - 
Reaping the heavens with a blithe
Song till the blue fields were bare.
Then, when the last gold bud was shaken free
And all the silver flowers of the night
Had rained and heaped about her there,
I threw the bright scythe into the sea. . . .

There was a hissing and an end of light. 
And we slept - dreamlessly.
