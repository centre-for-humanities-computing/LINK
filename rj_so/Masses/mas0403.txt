TO ENGLAND

Saviour of Little Folk; no less!
	You, with your heritage of hate!
 Champion of little people - yes;
	And murderer of the great.

Thief of the world, you stole their lands 
	And shot them down, or made them hang;
Not for the sword within their hands 
	But for the song they sang.

A song that flamed and would not die 
	Till it had burned the fetters free,
And spurred men on, and given the lie 
	To your pretense of liberty.

Why then put by the guns and whips; 
	Take them, and play ike champion's part. . . 
You, with a prayer upon your lips 
	And murder in your heart.
