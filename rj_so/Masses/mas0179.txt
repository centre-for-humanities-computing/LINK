THE DANCE

Riotous ragtime from the throb-
	bing strings - 
The booming horns and the drum's	rythmic roarâ€š - 
The ropes are loosened, and the golden 
	floorBecomes a garden of gay human things. 
Pale faces smile and the sad heart now 
	sings;And dreams stir sweetly, and pain sleeps 
	once moreIn those who know that dancing is a 
	doorTo fairy fanes where naught but laugh-
	ter rings.A frail one joyous, in her lover's arm, 
Like a weak flower enchanted by the 
	rain;Forgetting toil, heat, steam, and the
	alarmOf mad machines that roared through
	hours of pain.To her young soul the dance is sweet 
	and warm,Like light of spring where gloom and 
	cold have lain.
