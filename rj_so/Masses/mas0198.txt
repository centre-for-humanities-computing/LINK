WOOLWORTH CATHEDRAL

Lost in a climbing forest of sky-scrapers
Trinity sulks, a deserted shrine; 
Her few worshippers walk tremblingly, 
Sniffing the musty air from her buried dead, 
Senselessly mumbling over and over 
The ritual of a dead god.

Towering aloft into the conquered sky
The Woolworth Temple soars above its neighbors - 
A triumphant monument of the millions of worshippers
	of the true God of today. . . . 
Raised by blood-soaked and vice-stained pennies 
Squeezed out of weak and pitiful girls, 
Robbed of life and beauty,
That it might first kiss the morning sunshine;
Raised by trickling nickels and dimes
Levied on needy families,
That it might be a glory and a dream
In the soft gray shine of dusk,
And a pillar of white splendor at night,
Outsparkling the other lights of the city,
And the poor imitations passing slowly above it,
Night after night.

O Shrine of the God of Gold,
O Temple to the true God of Today,
Who will reign until we have made a new god, Man, 
To rule in earth and heaven,
I pause for a moment,
To lay a worshipper's tribute before you!
