SENSATIONS

Acres 
Of roses 
Fainting at noon 
In quivering sunlight. . . .

Ranks
Of white horses 
Impatient, caracolling, 
Jingling silver harness. . .

Music,
Faint and far-off 
And exotic
Like animals talking. . . .

Sunrise
On the desert,
Breathless with eager silence 
That out-beauties sound. . .
