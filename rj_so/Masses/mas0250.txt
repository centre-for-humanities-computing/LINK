WANTED

Idle his anvil stands, 
	His fire cold; 
Tools as they left his hands 
	Apron unrolled.

A piece half made,
	Dropped when he died. 
On whom is laid
	To do the thing he tried?

Skill he ha, but more:
	Not alone in iron he wrought. 
Gripping our inmost core 
	He shaped and bent our thought.

With eye that sees the end,
	Who then the man -  
What comrade, brother, friend 
	Will finish what he began.
