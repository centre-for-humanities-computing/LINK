"SEEK. . ."

"Seek; ye shall find."
	Great God in Heaven! We've sought 
		Ten thousand years! 
	What have we found? Water and Dust, 
		And Blood and Tears.

	"Ask, and receive." 
	Almighty God, we've prayed
		Ten thousand years! 
	And what received? Water and Dust,
		And Blood and Tears.

	"Knock; it shall open."
	My God ! But we have knocked
		Ten thousand years! 
	No answer. Only Water and Dust,
		And Blood and Tears.
