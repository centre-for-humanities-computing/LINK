THE SCULLION

Oh, for the wealth of the young Finnish girl
As she stands swaying,
Lithe as the timothy grass,
Her perfect, snug breasts
Like pink-tipped rosebuds
Showing through her lawn frock!
Oh, for the strong-limbed, full-limbed beauty of her
As she keeps her bloated fingers
In the big hands of her lover
And cackles her old-world music to him!
Oh, for the smell of her young hair,
Yellow and lush and matted like fronds of wheat,
And the animal fragrance of her developed body
As he seeks to enshrine her in his arms!
Oh, for the healthy folds of flesh
And the clean, soft creasing of flesh,
And the light dimpling,
As she writhes coyly from him
On her strong, bare feet!
Oh, for the large-faced, peasant moon
That spills the light upon them!
Oh, for the smooth, fresh skin beneath her eyes,
And the breathed dew of her lips,
And the blow of her breath like new-cut fields
,And the electric feel of her tight cheeks,
And the sweet dew of her muscular body,
And the pulse of her strong feet,
And her firm toes sinking in the soft grass and the clovers! 
Oh, for the plangent veins of her, 
And the choking passion of her,
And the filling surge of blood-wells beneath her heart! 
Oh, for the animal charm, 
The animal majesty of her!
