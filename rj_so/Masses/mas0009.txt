THE LAUGHING WOMAN

ONCE I heard a woman laughing -  
Not like laughter of the women you have heard; 
Syllables whose beauty blinds you, and reminds you 
Of a brook in sunlight, or a sweet, leaf-hidden bird. 
There is laughter that is human	Though shot through with notes of pain -  
And then there is that laughter of an old, old, evil woman, 
	Raising red and burning mists within the brain.

In the mad, gin-reeking dance-hall,Through the brainless oaths and shrieks, above the smoke
Of stale tobacco, burning to man's yearningFor the swinish, acrid incense - high and shrill her babbling broke. 
There is laughter that is human	Though its poignance starts our tears - 
And then there is a laughter like the laughter of that woman,	Freezing hearts, and ringing raucous- in our ears.

There were mingled in her laughter 
Girlish love-words, wittold curses, jests obscene. 
And the dancers swarmed around her, sunk profounder 
In their beastly, battening stupor‚Äîlove grown leathly and 
	unclean.There is laughter - bitter-human	Though it sears us hot and deep -  
And then there is a laughter like the laughter of that woman,	Worse than all the ghastly nightmares known to sleep.

Old gray hair, that had been honoredIn a life less foul than this, less mad with lust - Gray hair, denied, polluted, the refuted,Boast of Man, the world's white banner dragged and trampled in	the dust! 
There is laughter that is human,	Though the painfullest, the harshest - Yes - and then -  
And then there is the laughter of that old, old, evil woman.	And life still crawls with maggots - that were men!
