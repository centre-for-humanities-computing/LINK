LAUGH IT OFF

Have the Trusts devoured your pay? 
	Laugh it off. 
Do they cheat you night and day?
	Laugh it off. 
Don't make tragedy of trifles, 
Don't shoot butterflies with rifles - 
	Laugh it off.H

as the landlord raised your rent
	?Laugh it off. 
Have you spent your bottom cent?
	Laugh it off. 
If it's sanity you're after, 
There's no recipe like laughter - 
	Laugh it off.
