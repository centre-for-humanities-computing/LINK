TO WAT TYLER

Eight days of mortal history 
	Are your immortal soul -  
So brief survives the mystery 
	On England's ancient scroll.Y

et fifty thousand kings you crowned,
	And fifty thousand braves 
You moulded out of beaten ground, 
	The sons of sons of slaves.

You came like life through London gate,
	You made dull London ring 
With fighting love and fighting hate, 
	And treason to your king.

High treason on high Tower Hill,
	Most high the sacred word, 
When five old sores of England's ill 
	Were cured with a hot sword: - 

Was cured that bloody Treasurer,
	Sir Robert Hales - and worse, 
Old Legge, the royal usurer, 
	Who packed his bloody purse;

Was cured the King's High Chancellor,
	And higher and more near, 
The good confessor, Apuldore,
	Who kept His conscience clear;

And last and not least sinister, 
	Though saintly white his hand,
The Bishop and Arch Minister 
	Of meekness through the land,

Who poisoned freedom with a word, 
	Of all the drugs most dread - 
His Church, his Pope, his God the Lord 
	Could not defend his head.

The King, with still a kingly air,
	But more than kingly speed -  
Got forth to meet you in the square,
	Stood asking by your steed.

You laughed a level laugh, they say,
	And shook him by the hand: 
"We'll be good comrades - some fine day!"
	Your laugh was a command.

I know the charters that you won 
	Were fashioned of your breath,
Were lost like light of a. lost sun 
	The instant of your death.

I know that fighting liberty
	A full five hundred years 
Has wrestled death and agony
	In poverty and tears,

Since you first raised the vision
	Of workmen proud and free, 
In fighting high derision
	Of caste and tyranny.

And yet those eight exampled days
	No time can overwhelm; 
They are the height of England's praise,
	The hope of her dull realm.
