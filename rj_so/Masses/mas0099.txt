LOST MUSIC

I remember you now, 
My love.

It was eons ago
That I ran through the tangled woods 
After butterflies. . . .

I came to a sparkling pool 
And broke its smooth surface 
With my white feet.

Suddenly I paused in the mad cnase 
And beheld you 
For the first time.

You smiled
And held out your hand.
I went closer
Like a curious deer.

You were so beautiful
And so strong,
I had to keep gazing 
Beastlike. 

I looked so droll 
Standing there . . . 
That you laughed.

I can never forget 
The silver music 
Of your laughter.

That is how I remembered you
Today. . . 
You laughed again. 
But there is no joy 
In your, laughter now.

Oh, my love, 
Let us go back
Through all the ages behind us . . . 
Until we find the music 
That was in your laughter.
