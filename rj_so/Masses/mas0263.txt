THE CLOCK

With bloated and blotched and pasty face 
You leer over the city. 
Like a mouldy cheese

No use, you lying old timepiece, 
To put on so smug a mug, 
Or to set up to be a public benefactor, 
You whose works are forever breaking 
	down!

I know what is going on beneath that	scrofulous mask, 
You blurred lantern of the law: -

There are broken old fathers and	mothers W
With their youngest girl, 
Now swollen-eyed and smirched before	your bench; 
There are ladies with golden purses in	their hands, 
Seeking justice on the slavey who dared	to shareWhat gleams through those bright 
	meshes;And a drunken negress shrilling gro-
	tesque complaintAgainst her lawful captor;There are sodden old womenWith obscene flesh, once lissome and 
	desired,Rotting upon their bones, -They snivel in fear of another night 
	spent in your shelterInstead of in the gutter - outside.I know your hirelings, your plain-
	clothes pussy-foots,Young men chosen, like concubines, for 
	their beauty,Who prostitute the comeliness given 
	them of the godsTo fill your pens.They loiter on street-corners, -Lamps luring pitiful moths of girls;They spread their shining websAnd wait for the little fly-by-night 
	creatures to tangle their feet, - Then pounce and fatten.Their fresh young Greek lips curl in 
	incorruptible virtueAs they hold the flutterers up before 
	the judge and the court-room, 
	agape.

No, there is no use, Jefferson Market 
	clock,For you to hide your lascivious grin 
With your prim hands!
