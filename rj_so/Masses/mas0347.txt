CHOICES

They offer you many things, 
	I a few.
Moonlight on the play of fountains at night 
With water sparkling a drowsy monotone, 
Bare-shouldered, smiling women and talk 
And a cross-play of loves and adulteries 
And a fear of death
		and a remembering of regrets: 
All this they offer you. 
I come with:
		salt and bread 
		a terrible job of work 
		and tireless war; 
Come and have now: 
		hunger 
		danger
		and hate.
