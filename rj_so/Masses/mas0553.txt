ONCE IN A BLUE, BLUE MOON

The South Wind sighed, and bluebirds cried, 
Once in a blue, blue moon. 
And fairies were lost, and woe betide 
The man who ventured to take their side! 
Once in a blue, blue moon.

And streams ran up instead of down, 
Once in a blue, blue moon. 
And the travelers who came to town 
Turned red and yellow, green and brown, 
Once in a blue, blue moon.

At black midnight the sun came up, 
Once in a blue, blue moon.  
And a violet looked like a buttercup, 
And hogs had tea to talk and sup, 
Once in a blue, blue moon.

And palaces flew into air,
Once in a blue, blue moon.
And a young girl sat with a woman's stare,
And there was here and here was there,
Once in a blue, blue moon.
