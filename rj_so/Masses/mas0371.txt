FINIS

A dingy room that through a win-
	dow sucks 
Smoke and the reek of shambles on the 	air.One spot that gathers all the senses in, 
Obliterates the rest, a corner where 
A thing who was a woman, back to wall.
Run to the ground, sits snarling in her 
	lair.A woman once, dealing and taking 
	blows,A child in some unthinkable far dawn, 
Suckled in streets that to her death 
	send upBloat laughter and this stench. As live 
	things spawn 
She bore her litter, some alive, some 
	dead,And now is impotent. Her sting is 
	drawn.Fighter and hater, old, and eaten 
	throughBy poison of her living; sodden gray, 
Cornered but venomous, she holds with 
	eyesOf livid, smouldering hate, in strange 
	delayThe great, implacable white Lord of 
	Death,Baring her teeth and keeping him at bay.
