THE THREE WHOSE HATRED KILLED THEM

These wild, bitter men, whose iron hatred burst 
	too soon,
Judge them not harshly, O comrades. 
Forgive them their sin, for they loved much. 
They hated, but it was the enemy of man they hated. 
They lusted for man's blood, but it was the blood of
	those who shed man's blood they lusted for. 
They sought to spoil God's clay, but it was to save
	much more of that sacred stuff that they sought
	this.

Think of them, dear comrades, as fellow soldiers too
	impatient to await the signal. 
Undisciplined warriors, aflame for battle and loath to 
	bide the issue 
Until came reinforcements, fresh troops by love and
	reason recruited, 
Singing as they came to join us, the Army of the
	Brotherhood of Man.
