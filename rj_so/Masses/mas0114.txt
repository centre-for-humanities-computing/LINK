THE SINGING MOUTH

O singing mouth! We kiss thee, but no more Shall kisses waken song from thee, or bring From those bruised lips the music of revolt! Stamped to dead ashes the rebellious fire Which blazed in song to an unheeding world; And thou art one of that long outcast roll Whose scorching life has come to nothingness!Poor crude and stammering chords of a great heart -  Clumsy and weak, untrained by leisured thought, Struck out to the surged sound of factories, And mingled with the groans of earth upheaving In long crushed agony‚Äîhow shall they live? What is there left of all thy bitterness? -Lies not thy struggling soul in utter death ?No! - from thy weary silence comes a voice,And it shall call till every wind of earth.Catching that sound, shall stir the hearts of menTo vowed endeavor, to a destined war,Hot mother of the white and living Peace;And vindicated Truth shall stoop to touchThee, her own brother, with her free-flying wings.Holy rebellion breathes within our air;We are dream-goaded to a prophet's deed,And aspiration is made sharp with hope!Still singing mouth, thy voice shall be a cryTo urge us to the sacred wrath of war.God shall look down and bless our singing brother,And make his death a sweetness in the world!
