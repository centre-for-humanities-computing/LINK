I AM AFRAID TO FACE THE SPRING

I am afraid to face the Spring; 
I haven't any heart to pass 
The wayside lilacs blossoming, 
The sunlight drowsing in, the  grass. . . 
It isn't dear to me at all; 
My hungry eyes can only see 
The shrivelled leaves of days  that fall 
And drift about me wearily. . . 

I hear that Spring is back again, 
That flame-buds kindle all about; 
But in my heart the buds of pain 
Are swiftly breaking, breaking out! 
And yet its when I see the skies 
And pass the lilacs blossoming  
(Sweet lilacs laughing windily, 
That once she used to give me!) 
A sudden mist is in my eyes: 
I cannot understand 'this thing; 
I have no heart to face the Spring!
