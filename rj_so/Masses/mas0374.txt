I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS

I am always trying to find out about 
	thingsAnd I said to the virgin,"It must be wonderful to be free - To belong to yourself,Unanguished by the terrible uncertain
	ties of love,To be like the city in October,Bright and cold and well-tailored with no 
	nonsense about it."

And the maiden said, "If you only knew 
How the desperate strain eats into one Always to be on the lookout 
On the way to work, at work, coming 
	home,And the ironic blackness of the occa-
	isonal "free" evening 
When nothing happens to keep me from 
	thinking."

Then I said to the woman who had
	 found her lover 
Who lived with one man happily un-
	concerned about others,"How content you must be - What a relief to have nothing to wonder 
	about 
Or wait for!"

"Wonder and wait!" she said - 
"It is all I do."

Yet I can't help trying to find out about 
	things.Especially love.
