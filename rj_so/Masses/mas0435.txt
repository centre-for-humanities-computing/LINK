REBELLION

Closing my office door, I turn the 
	key
And wander down into the surging 
	street
Where through the radiant light the
	wind blows sweet, 
Bringing a tang of salt from distant
	sea.
I merge into the crowd that jostles me 
And drift alone, with not a friend to 
	greet.

Strong with the strength of youth and
	health am I! 
Success is mine, quoted at market rate. 
But I am stifled with a bitter cry, 
I scorn my fruitless body and my fate. 
Daughter of pioneers, I hate my barren
	years,
When heart and soul and blood long 
	for a mate!

A mate, greater than I, of splendid 
	mould,
With keen eyes seeing clear and
	strength to do -  
A man, with skilful hands and heart
	of gold,
Eager for beauty, passionate and true -  
My hopes and fears and my rebellious
	tears
Are spent in wanton, wistful quest of 
	you!

Back at my office door ! I turn the 
	key,
Shutting away the clamor of the street. 
I am alone - alone. I can take my seat 
Before the piled up work awaiting me.
Far out beyond my window lies the sea, 
Freedom - great spaces where the wind 
	blows sweet.
