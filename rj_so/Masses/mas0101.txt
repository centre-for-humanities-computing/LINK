TO A GIRL ON A MAGAZINE COVER

Your smeared and smirking little 
	bag,
You plump, appealing little brute, 
	you,
Displayed to please when senses flag, 
	You little paper prostitute, you:

You seem to fix on us afresh
	Those eyes imploring and unwinking 
Which speak the promptings of the flesh
	And set some lusty fellow thinking:

And with a pittance for your price 
	The lightest laggard may dethrone 
		you;
So little matters it, suffice 
	It profits some those men that own 
		you!

The men who drew the soul from you 
	And left an empty, painted body;
Who found less profit in the true, 
	A ready market for the shoddy:

And to the lure within their snare
	 Came gifted youth with all its treasure,
And fouled its fairest, freshest ware, 
	To sate the tradesmen with the measure:

And so, you little clap-trap queen, 
	There's scarce a seemly name to suit you
Who might have a Giaconda been, 
	You little paper prostitute, you.
