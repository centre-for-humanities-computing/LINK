SWEAT-SHOP FLOWERS

"Daisies have a hundred petals,
	 primroses have five," 
So she used to count them when she
	was alive; 
"Daisies have a hundred petals, butter-
	cups have seven," 
So she sits and sings it in the fields of 
	heaven,
Making clover blossoms quaintly 
For the fields of Paradise.

"Daisies have a hundred petals, butter-
	cups have seven,"
Other children pass her in the fields 
	of heaven.
"Come and play with us," they call her 
	through the sapphire noon.
"All my shining flowers," she answers, 
	"must be finished soon,"
And their laughter trails out faintly
As they run across the skies.

"Daisies have a hundred petals, prim-
	roses have five,"
It was all they taught her when she 
	was alive;
It is all she knows now; passing angels. 
	hear "her say,
"I must make buds for the bonnets 
	they will wear on Easter day,
Crocuses and snow-drops dainty
And sweet bluebells like their eyes."

"Daisies have a hundred petals, butter-
	cups have seven."
Oh, the day is long and long in the 
	fields of heaven!
"Twenty rosebuds fashioned neatly, 
	they will give a copper penny
,Pennies ten are bread and butter for
	 the mouths that have not any,
"And she makes the blossoms quaintly
For the fields of Paradise.
