PRAYER FOR ANNIHILATION

Now all that man has prated of so much 
	Falls into dust-heaps at a hostile touch, 
Religion's vestments dissolve in futile vapor,
	A nation's honor rots to a scrap of paper: 
Before we die, honest for once, we dare
	Stand naked and candid without one lying prayer.

For the red wrong that man has thought and done 
	Runs still before him like a blazing sun,
The deft hand's triumph and the high brain's skill 
	Teach him but more effectual means to kill,
And higher throned than Christ or Socrates
	 Still sworded Caesar lolls in purple ease.

If Thou be God, with tempest-knuckled wrath 
	Smite smug creation from its complacent path,
Batter the stars and snuff sun's candle out, 
	Show once thy face and quiet all the shout - 
A God of order, pavilioned still in strife, 
	No wonder man thy creature muddles life!

If Thou indeed be God, no matter where
	Throned in what sanctities of air, 
Or clad in flame, in storm or ruin going
	,Meek or embittered, cruel or all-knowing, 
Prove for all time beyond the reach of doubt
	That thou art God, and blot this mad world out!
