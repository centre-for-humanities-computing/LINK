THE SWORD OF FLAME

Comrades of youth with whom I sat last night around a hospitable hearth,Sweet converse was that we held together. 
Yet I know it was all and only for the sake of the old days - 
Days when we pelted each other with rosebuds all in life's young	Rose-garden, 
Undreaming what lay beyond its wall.Save for memory of that time, you are my soul-comrades no longer,Nor kin in any sort but as all men are by the common tie.So I gave myself to you and to light commonplaces and gay remi-
	niscences for an hour.Well knowing what would be, if, instead, I had thrown into the 
	midst of the charmed circleThe bomb of a fiery thought - The dynamite of democracy -The terrible Truth that is come to send a sword on Earth, 
Albeit it be but, as we fondly trust, a Sword of the Spirit - 
None the less a Sword of sundering - Dread Sword of Flame that bars so many out of their small safe 
	Edens of old loves and friendships - their young rose-gardens,Pointing its own burning way the while to a -better Paradise to 
	come.The bomb was never thrown, the word never spoken. I said goodnight.We go on our separate ways, yet toward one Goal. 
You in the rear and I in the van. You unwilling - I willing, eager. 
You blinded and unbelieving, I walking by faith. 
May we reach it in your day, in my day, O friends, that you be my
	heart-comrades once more!
