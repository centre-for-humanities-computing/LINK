ANTI-SUFFRAGE SENTIMENTS

A delicate Angora cat
Had whiskers; but, pray, what of that? 
"I don't want to vote," 
To a friend she once wrote; 
"My place is at home on the mat."

"LET me hold the umbrella, my dear," 
Mrs. Hen said to kind Chantecleer.
"'Tis man's privilege, love." 
And he held it above 
His own head, so it dripped in her ear.
