THE JOB

I saw the young man with his wife on the day that	he got news of his job. The long winter was over, and the Works that were	shut down had opened their doors.The wife was a slim, brown-haired young thing, mother 	of the month-old baby that lay in its crib.She was too pale for beauty, but the dawn rose in her face 	as the news was told.They laughed aloud; they hugged each other, heedless	of onlookers. Their faces were transfigured with happiness. They snatched the child from his cradle, and swung	him in his little blue blanket merrily to a hummed	dance-tune.I have seen manifestations of exalted joy - The dithyrambic ecstasies of religious emotion,The worshipper, passionate, pouring out his soul upon	the choral tide of praise; Lovers on their marriage morning, with faces brighter	than its sunlight; The watcher vigil-worn to whom the doctor has just	said, "Your dear one will live;" The mother dreaming goldenly above the face of her	first-born:But never have I seen joy purer in quality or in expression 	more beautiful (Holding within it something of the rapture of all) Than that of the boy and girl over the good news of 	a job.
