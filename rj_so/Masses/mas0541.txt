SORROW

Out of a broken heart
I'll make a song! 
And I will sing it on bare, bare hills, 
Myself, alone!

The stormy sombre clouds 
Will weep to see 
The ever-hungry, tearless eyes, 
Of Misery.

The birds will fly in circles 
Silently,
Knowing full well the joyless song - 
Captivity. - 

Yes, captive am I of Sorrow, 
Fear, and Care.
Walking - my hand in the clinging hand 
Of dumb Despair!
