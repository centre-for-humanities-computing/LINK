LOST LEADERS

I wonder in what prison grey
	Bill Kelley's ravings fill the air - 
Broken, defeated and at bay,
	Like hunted beast in fetid lair,
	Lost in the twilight of despair. H
e did his work and drew his pay.
	With flaming zeal and courage rare
 He led a strike of yesterday.

 wonder where as calls the fray
	That marks the workers' next advance 
Big Tony shuffles on his way,
	His manhood broken lance by lance.
	Upon what breadline falls his glance? 
He did his work and drew his pay.
	Now hunger leads a spectral dance. 
He led a strike of yesterday.

I wonder where as falls the day,
	On toilers dreaming dreams sublime 
Tom Carney rots in death's decay?
	His red heart broken in his prime.
	His spirit strives in what far clime? 
The cops have beaten his breath away.
	Hate holds the heights his love would climb. 
He led a strike of yesterday.

Slaves and their masters - pair by pair, 
	They slink or strut in chains alway,
Keepers or kept - Oh, tell me where - 
	Where are the men of yesterday?
