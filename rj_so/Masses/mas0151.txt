COMING TO PORT

Our motion on the soft still misty river
Is like rest; and like the hours of doom 
That rise and follow one another ever 
Ghosts of sleeping battle-cruisers loom 
And languish quickly in the liquid gloom.

From watching them your eyes in tears are gleaming, 
And your heart is still; and like a sound 
In silence is your stillness in the streaming 
Of light-whispered laughter all around, 
Where happy passengers are homeward bound.

Their sunny journey is in safety ending,
But for you no journey has an end;
The tears that to your eyes their light are lending
Shine in softness to no waiting friend;
Beyond the search of any eye they tend.

There is no nest for the unresting fever 
Of your passion, yearning, hungry-veined; 
There is no rest nor blessedness forever 
That can clasp you, quivering and pained, 
Whose eyes burn forward to the unattained.

Like time, and like the river's fateful flowing, 
Flowing though the ship has come to rest, 
Your love is passing through the mist and going, 
Going infinitely from your breast, 
Surpassing time on its immortal quest.

The ship draws softly to the place of waiting,
All flush forward with a joyful aim,
And while their hands with happy hands are mating,
Lips are laughing out a happy name - 
They see you pass among them like a flame.
