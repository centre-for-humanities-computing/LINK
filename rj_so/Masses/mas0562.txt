IN A SOUTHERN GARDEN

		PINK DOGWOOD
BABY hands, wide spread,
Reach for the golden April sun; 
Then brush my cheek and, touching me
 With groping tenderness they bring 
In sudden, breathless, yearning pain, 
The agony of spring.

		TO A JAPONICA TREE 
THROW your red kisses to the laughing sun,
Drop them upon the warm and sleeping earth, 
Strain to the wind with your unquenched desire -  
There is no fragrance in your hot-lipped fire; 
You give too eagerly, oh, wanton one!

		LIVE OAK 
LIFE is so still and simple when I lay
My head against your bark and rest and feel
 Your mighty strength, too great for consciousness - 
Night is above you, and the milky way; 
Around your foot the drowsy violets nod; 
I wonder - do men mean this when they say 
"The love of God"?
