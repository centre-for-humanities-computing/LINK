TRUTH

Yesterday Truth was a rock
Of granite immutable 
On which to stand, a bed 
Unshakable on which to lie,
Our grandfathers believed, nor questioned why.

Today on a hollyhock 
Truth lights, an inscrutable 
Changeling, now here then fled 
To another flower, a butterfly, 
"Ephemeral insect truth!" our children cry.
