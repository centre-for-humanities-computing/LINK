BLACK MAGIC

The web was spun from sun to sun - 
	A cunning web of blue -  
And every night the strands are bright 
	With globes of starry dew.

The web was drawn across the dawn - 
	A web of living flame - 
They screamed to feel the hidden steel,
	They gave their fear a name.

And those who cried, and those who died,
	They made a god of dread; 
They saw at last the web made fast
	And wore the knotted thread.

The web is rent - the sky is bent - 
	Ah, laughers in the sun, 
You wove the spider in the sky,
	Yours was the web he spun!
