THE BENEFACTOR

"It's not your job to right the world's wrongs, son," 
	You said, and smugly lit a cigarette
	.Till loveliness and beauty I forget, 
Till wretchedness and ugliness have won, 
Or till my little stretch of life is done, 
	I shall remember something of the debt 
	I owe to you. You stabbed me with regret
 For all the years I smiled and angered none.

Now I shall be a hornet, and my tongue 
	Shall leave no man complacent I can reach. 
	I have no gift of leadership or speech,
But I shall make them writhe whom I have stung. 
	And maybe for their very hate of me 
	The blind shall try to answer and shall see.
