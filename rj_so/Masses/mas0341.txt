EVOLUTION

"Ho! mystical Science, where are you going,
With your Cause and your fistful of Laws, 
And your burden of broken Gods on your back -  
Where are you going so merrily, 
Traveling all the day?"

"The where I am going there is no knowing, 
And there is no reach of human speech 
That can stay me a minute or call me back. 
I don't know where I am going 
But I am on my way."
