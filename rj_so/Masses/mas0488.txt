FOR LYRIC LABOR

Child of the Renaissance and little  
		sister
Of Ariosto and of Raphael, 
If any hush the song within your bosom,
	By all your lyric land, he does not 
		well!

One day a traveler from our songless 
		country,
	Passing at morning through Saint 
		Mark's great Square, 
Marvelled, from workmen on the cam-
		panile,
	To hear a song arising on the air.

Marvelled to see those stones of Venice 
		rising
	To Labor's matin chant intoned so 
		clear 
As the great towers builded by Amphion 
	Rose to the lyre's strong throbbing, 
		tier on tier.

Give us, O Child, the gifts we lack full 
		sorely - 
	Give us your heritage of art and song, 
The soul that in our fathers grew, sun-
		nourished, 
	Soaring above its poverty and wrong.

Of singing vintagers and laughing reap-
		ers
	Teach us your happy, sunland way, 
		nor we
In blind greed longer lay a stern pro-
		scription
	Upon your song, O Heart of Italy!

Free and serene, in his reward unstint-
		ed, 
	The workman's hand shall mould his 
		rhythmic thought; 
How candid to the keen-eyed gods' ap-
		praisal
	Shall be the work of Man's great 
		ardor wrought,

When our young land, reborn in 
		Beauty's image, 
	Unto the Morn of Prophecy shall 
		Come,
And every tower be raised with mirth 
		and music, 
	And every harvest brought with sing-
		ing home.
