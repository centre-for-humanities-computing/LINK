A TEACHER

It was late afternoon. 
Wearily a yellow streak of sunlight
Fell through the blue net curtains,
Making greenish shadows on your face,
And over your heavy shoulders. 
I watched you strain to sit straight
On the stiff chair by the piano's side,
While a heedless and hurrying girl
Stumbled over her scales,
And giggled out her excuses
With the gauche coquetry of fourteen.

I thought of your reaching aims, 
And of how you were always giving 
From your heart and brain; 
Giving from the toil of years -  
Giving yourself;
Of the many you urged to hardier striving; 
Of those who were eased and lifted -  
And of those - like this thin-souled child - 
For whom sacrifice was vain.

And when a patient smile lit up your face, 
Warming your eyes, but deepening the ruts of care, 
I was reminded of lamplight in a well-loved room -  
Lamplight that cheered, but whose drooping beams 
Revealed the shabbiness of near-by chairs, 
And deepened the shadows.
