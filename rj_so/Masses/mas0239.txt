PURSERY RHYME

Sing a song of Europe,
	Highly civilized.
 Four and twenty nations
	Wholly hypnotized.

When the battles open
	The bullets start to sing; 
Isn't that a silly way
	To act for any king?

The kings are in the background
	Issuing commands; 
The queens are in the parlor,
	Per etiquette's demands.

The bankers in the counting house
	Are busy multiplying; 
The common people at the front,
	Are doing all the dying.
