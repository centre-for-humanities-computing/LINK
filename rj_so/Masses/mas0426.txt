OF A NIGHT

'Tis the devil of a night all hot and 
	sweet
Till a sweat not ichor gets in the 
	blood,
And we chafe and chide to be glued to 
	a seat;
Damn it, I say, but I must abroad! 

Out in the night to wander, wander,
Out in the night with the sweet mad
	scent
Under the shadowy elm-arch yonder -  
	Shadows and sounds and odors blent!

Give me your arm; we'll strike forever 
A stride to reach to the front of the
	day
Meet it and greet it! Ah, friend, did 
	you ever
Feel lips of a girl like the Night's
	astray?

Over your brow and your cheek and 
	your eyes, 
Touching year hands, down neck so 
	cool,
A shiver forever, mad, mad surprise? 
	- Wander we; who sleeps is a fool.

Wander, wander! The sky is yonder, 
	Up, aye a million miles out of sight;
And here walk we with souls to ponder 
	The bliss of a kiss from the Infinite!

Give me your arm; our stride be 
	straight,
Over the world to the front of the
	day
Breast to breast with the flaming Gate 
	When the marvel breaks with the 
		mists away; - 

Breaks untrammeled of scent or sound; 
Breaks like God from his Word and is 
	He;
Breaks as my soul leaps free of the
	 ground - 
Flung back, to arise at last and be!
