THE SUN

Now autumn, and that sadness, as of love, 
Heroic in immortal solitude;
Those veins of flaming passion through the wood;
But in the blue unburdened infinite above
A shining circle like the light of truth,
Self-poising, tranquil, his desire sublime,
Whose motion is the measurement of time,
Whose step is morning, and his smile is youth.

No passion burns upon the livid earth
Whose stain can tint that circle, or whose cry 
Can rout the tranquilly receiving sky. 
All passion, all its crimson stream, from birth
To murder, bloom and pestilential blight,
All flows beneath the sanction of his light.
