THE FIELDS OF FRANCE

Last night I sat with a dying man 
And sadly watched the waning breath,
Anxiously waiting each halting return; 
And I thought how unlovely a thing is death,
And yet perchance
He stalks more grim o'er the fields of France.

One time I saw a wounded stag
Spring past and then plunge down in pain;
Still as the hunter paused to aim
The quarry was up and off again. 
At least it seemed he had a chance: 
It is not so on the fields of France.

But once in a slaughter-house I saw
The trembling squealing creatures led
To the tackle and then swung in the air,
The sickening thrust and the fountain of red.
"Dull things," I mused, "they had no chance."
And it's men instead on the fields of France.
