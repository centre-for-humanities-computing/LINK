THE WAR THEY NEVER FOUGHT

The Millionaire went forth to fight in 
	The War They Never Fought,The Broker and the Banker, each a place in the 
	vanguard sought,The Preacher left the church behind to march, and 
	shoulder a gun,The Senator tied on his sword, the Magnate sent 
	his son,Then, finding war so fine a thing, he put by all his 
	pelf,And took a rifle in his hand, and went to war him-
	self;The King served on the battleship, he fought as 
	gunner there,The Emperor went forth on foot the lot of war to 
	share,And none of them on horses rode, but side by side 
	they went,And carried knapsacks, slept in rain, and ate hard	fare, content . . . 
The Poor, the Poor, they stayed at home while all	these bore the brunt, 
Charging, and breasting cannon balls, and starving,	at the front:Yes, all the Workers stayed at home and knew a 
	happy lot - The Ruling Classes were so brave in The War They 
	Never Fought!
