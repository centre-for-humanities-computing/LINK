THE MOUSE

There was a little Clerk we called The Mouse, 
	 A timid man, worn smooth by petty strife, 
Who dragged his days out in a boarding house, 
	He was a nibbler at the crumbs of life.

By day he cast up figures in a book,
	 Made neat accounting of his brother's gold,
Sat in a cage, and wore the prison look.
	The years had left him neither young nor old.

His window faced the sea. . . He saw the ships 
	Come with their cargoes, but to him it meant
Only an ink-stain on his finger tips, 
	A balance struck, a penny earned or spent.

He blotted romance with a business phrase, 
	Marked bold adventure down upon a slate,
A little Mouse, caught in a trap of days, 
	Who did not even wonder at the bait.

The god of habit ruled his sunless mind,
	 Locked out experience, kept each drab thought
Where he could touch it, for his soul was blind! 
	He was the price by which our world is bought.

One twilight, when the sky bloomed like a rose, 
	In April's garden, and the world was sweet
With that slow smile of heaven in repose, 
	The Mouse came treading primly through his street.

And suddenly, as though a hand were thrust 
	To draw him to his fate, the wind in glee
Snatched off his hat and whirled it in the dust; 
	He stood the victim of a tragedy.

A sense of nakedness, of being bare,
	Gripped at his soul. He gave a startled cry,
Plunged after it. . . . His lungs drank deep of air, 
	He saw the scarlet flower of the sky.

The light fell on his eyes and blinded him,
	He shook his naked head, ran on - ran, ran, 
Till earth and all its purposes grew dim, 
	His heart sang on his lips: "Thou art a man!"

Out of the shadow of the Piers there came
	A great-wheeled truck. ... A shout; then curses, screams,
Voices . . "He's dead." "Get back there." "What's his name?"
	The Mouse lay smiling as one smiles in dreams.
