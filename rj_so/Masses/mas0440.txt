DAMNED

"He's trying to break up the Home!" 
	Get it?
	That's the secret: that's the Big League shortstop 
that's always ready to stop short anybody who starts 
out to do anything that hasn't been done steady for 
the past thousand years. He's trying to break up the 
Home
	Does he want Pure Food? Then he's trying to break 
up the dear little pink and white homes of the Food 
Adulterators.
	Does he want Safety in Mines? Then he's trying 
to break up the mountain homes and the seaside homes 
and the Italian palace homes of the Mine Operators.
	Does he want Disease isolated? Then he's trying to
 break up the homes of all those poor dear people with 
funny insides.
	It's a grand old blanket accusation - a double bar-
reled shotgun with an extra dose of buckshot: it will
 hit almost anybody it's aimed at.
	He's trying to break up the Home.
	But don't let the Public know that the only Home 
he wants to break up is some filthy, germ-soaked shack, 
and that he only wants to break it up so that there 
will be room to build a big brick house with a furnace
and open plumbing.
	Don't get so close to the Truth that it burns you.
	Just nod your head and jerk your thumb over your 
shoulder and say under your breath, "He's trying to
break up the Home."
