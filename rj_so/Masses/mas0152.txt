PREPARED

As long as I can hang a Jew and burn a nigger, 
Or ride the labor agitator on a rail; 
As long as I can put any man I don't like 
In jail, and keep him there
On the flimsiest pretext or none, 
And shut the mouth of the fool 
Who cries for free speech and assembly -  
When for chastity's sake, I jail the prostitute 
After I'm through with her; when, revering mother-
	hood,
I snatch the bread from the lips of the working mother; 
When unwritten laws proclaim my belief 
In the sacredness of lust, jealousy, possession and re-
	venge,
And the written law's limit is given those who stir up 
	discontent;
When I can throttle science and art and the right ta 
	belief and opinion,
My prejudices squatting like toads in the path of free-
	dom;
When God is officially my pal and does my dirty work, 
And I can kill a political rival with the terms "Atheist" 
And "Free-lover" - even though my own life smells to 
	heaven;
When I can put a ban on truth and make obscenity pay 
	dividends;
When American life is kept cheap and American profits
	sacred,
Why shouldn't I stand prepared to defend American 
	freedom?
Why shouldn't I shed my blood as well as the blood of 
	my neighbor
To guard these inherited rights against any alien in-
	vader?
