I.W.W.

Sons of the sansculottes,
Savage, erect, disdainful, 
Proud of their pariah estate,
They return to the civilization that has cast them out, 
Hate for hate and blow for blow.
Society denied them all life's sweet, soft, comfortable-things, 
And so society raised up unto itself its destroyers.

Reckless of the jails, of the policemen's clubs, of the lynch-
	ing parties made up of frightened good citizens,
Cheerfully accepting the anathema of all reputable people 
	and lovers of law and order,
They laugh aloud and sing out of their little red book
Blasphemous ribaldries against all the gods and all the mas-
	ters.
(Beware, gods and masters, of rebels who laugh and sing!) 
Onward to the conquest of earth these outlaws press, 
Pausing by the corpses of their martyrs only long enough 
To utter, grim-lipped, "We remember!"
