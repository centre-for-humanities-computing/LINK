HANDS

Hands! 
Twin partners of the soul,
Independent yet affinities,
Proud, self-sufficient,
And beautiful as music over calm
	waters; 
I see them waving gracefully, 
As if explaining some dumb 
Hidden friend'that has not 
Words with which to speak. 
Hands!
Soft, slender, pliable, eloquent, 
Interpreting the soul with 
Graceful gestures.
