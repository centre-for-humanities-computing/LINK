PROTEST

Ah, let me sing of love while I can: 
	While the young hot blood throbs 
	in my lips 
And my heart can leap and tremble to 
	view a warm-white-throated dam-
	sel or a blue-veined foot; 
While I can smile to a rosebud. 
Why make me hum of your "ics" and	your "isms" W
hen I feel I could woo every woman	in the world 
And the butterfly is my brother? 
As well hold a spray of the balsam fir 
	to the bill of the caged songbird 
	and bid him hush. 
Why will you make me seek in 
	the subway or at a mass meeting 
	when I have it in my own heart?
