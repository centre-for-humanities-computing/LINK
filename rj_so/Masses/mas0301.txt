JUSTICE

Sing a song of lawyers,
	Pockets full of dough,
 Four and twenty legal lights
	Defending rich John Roe. 
When the case is opened
	Lawyers 'gin to say, 
"Judge, this is misuse of power 
	To treat the man this way." 
Jury in the jury box think it's awful funny, 
Witnesses are planning what they'll say to earn their 
	money,
Judge begins to think it's 'gainst the interests of the
	 place
To try a wealthy citizen - he decides to quash the case.
