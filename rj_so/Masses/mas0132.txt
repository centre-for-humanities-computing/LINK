SUBMARINE

My soul is a submarine.My aspirations are torpedoes. 
I will hide unseen 
Beneath the surface of life 
Watching for ships, 
Dull, heavy-laden merchant ships, 
Rust-eaten, grimy galeons of com-
	merceWallowing with obese assurance, 
Too sluggish to fear or wonder,
Mocked by the laughter of waves 
And the spit of distainful spray.

I will destroy them 
Because the sea is beautiful.

That is why I lurkMenacinglyIn green depths.
