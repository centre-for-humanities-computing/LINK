THE FOOL

I came unbidden into Life  
From my Utopian Way; 
The Host and Hostess at the door 
Smiled as they said me nay;

But while They smiled, God let me
	through -  
How cruel 'twas of Him 
To leave me lying in the Dark -  
Me, with no Lamp to trim;

While Others play among the lights, 
I laugh beside the Dark, 
And, hungry, snatch my bread and 
	drink,
Tho' I be clothed or stark;

Unbidden at the Feast of Life, 
I know not whence I came, 
And no one holds my wavering hands 
Nor teaches me the Game;

And now I have no wish! for Light, 
For God and Life, no hate: 
Ha? They may smile - I dance and 
	laugh - 
Last night I found a mate.
