ON A WORKMAN ASLEEP IN A SUBWAY TRAIN

There is a holiness upon him 
More touching than is death; 
His care-contorted brow, 
His hands half clenched 
As though they held in sleep the heavy 
	hammer,Forging in labored, sweaty dreams:At bay, beyond his heavy calm,Until some jolting of the train shall	force his weary lids apart, 
Wait sickness, hunger, death, 
To worry once more at his steps, 
And threaten anew the creatures of his	incoherent love: 
Between him and catastrophe 
Is but the flicker of each day, Whereby he forges crude utilities, 
A while to mark his silent, patient jour-
	ney to oblivion: 
And we who reckon life in periods of 
	ease,Alternate with joyous, care-free toil, 
Have set for him our own moralities, 
And with half-comprehended platitudes	have pierced his unprotesting	brain, - 

Watch we now his tired eyes open, 
And his unrested bulk arise.
