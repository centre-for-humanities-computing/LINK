THE WINDS OF SPRING

All day have the winds of spring blown in, 
	At the grating above our heads,
All day have the warm, sweet winds puffed in, 
	While we watched the running threads,
Blown over the chimneys, up from the streets, 
	And the loose-board, alley sheds.

O, we may not stop, nor lift an eye,
	We may not stop to see, 
Where the shoals of the mackerel clouds float by,
	Lest a snapping thread swing free.

But I know for all the whirr of wheels, 
	And the clack of the loom's gaunt frame,
That the winds are calling, calling away, 
	From the factory's gray-faced shame,
Are tugging like tiny hands at my skirt,
	And singing in tears my name.

O, mad, young wind, from far and near,
	Wind of the hill and sea, 
I may not stop for your song, nor hear,
	Lest a snapping thread swing free.
