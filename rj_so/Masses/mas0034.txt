THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE OFFERTORY

A loud "Amen !"  - the pastor then 
	Surveyed his silent flock, 
While here and there a worshipper 
	Cast sheep's eyes at the clock.

A solemn pause (which always awes); 
	The deacons four uprose; 
The congregation sighed and searched 
	Supinely through its clothes.

The people kneeled, the organ pealed
	A sacred roundelay; 
The pastor raised his arms and smiled:
	"Now, brethren, let us prey!"
