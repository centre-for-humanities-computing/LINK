ABOVE THE HILL

A forest of sharp skeletons flame-seared,
They stand above the hill, the ancient trees, 
A waste of broken trunks the shells have cleared 
Of swaying branch and leaf and woodland ease.

So still they are, the Spring shall turn aside, 
Summer shall never touch their blackened sleep. 
They know - they know earth's laughing heart has died, 
The ancient trees, whose roots have pierced so deep.
