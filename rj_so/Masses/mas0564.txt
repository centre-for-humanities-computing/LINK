PORTRAIT OF A FRIEND

And what is this that tried to bite me? You? 
	I cannot quite believe it. Yet I see 
What first I thought was nothing but a flea
Is nothing but my friend. So it is true
hat you who battened on my strength, and grew 
	Fat on my love and your own vanity, 
	Now strike at what you never dared to be
And try to foul the things you cannot do.

You are indeed a curious sort of thing;
	An angry worm that thinks it is a snake, 
Hissing because it cannot hope to sing.
	And even here you fail. My friend, you make
	A sorry serpent; you can only shake Y
our borrowed rattles, but you cannot sting.
