BILLY SUNDAY

He raised his hands high and he clenched his fists 
	tight,
He jumped to the left and he leaped to the right, 
He sat on the floor and he stood on a chair, 
He ruffled his shirt and he towsled his hair,
 He howled and he yelled and he twisted and squirmed, 
He crawled and he sprawled and he wiggled and 
	wormed,
He ranted and raved and his face became red, 
He danced and he hollered and stood on his head, 
He rattled, he prattled, he ripped and he tore, 
He chattered, he splattered, he stamped and he swore; 
He cracked a poor joke and he told an old story, 
He pointed the way to his heaven and glory; 
He took off his coat and he tore off his tie, 
He swore every faith but his own was a lie.
 He drew a fine line with a thin piece of chalk 
And declared if thereon you were careful to walk 
You'd arrive in his heaven and all would be well, 
But that all other ground was the pathway to hell. 
He told us the devil for each of us waited, 
He shouted, he spouted, he gesticulated, 
He roared and he shrieked and he foamed at the
	 mouth,
He pawed the air north and he split the air south, 
He sneered and he snarled and his eyes became wild -  
And all in the name of the Christ who was mild.

The people were pleased with these elegant scenes, 
They yelled their approval and gave of their means, 
They filled his hat full to the brim with their gold,
To hear the glad tidings that hell is not cold.
