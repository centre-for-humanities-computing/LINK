A CHILDLESS WIFE

I always wanted to have a baby. 
When I was a little bit of a girl 
I loved my doll babies best of all my
	playthings,
 Because I could pretend I was their
	mother.
Now they tell me I never can have 
	one.
I thought for a long time there was 
	something wrong with me.
While I was at the hospital
I heard some one whisper "Honey-
	moon appendicitis."
They thought I didn't hear,
But I heard and understood.
They say men are like that,
But - God! I never thought mine was.
