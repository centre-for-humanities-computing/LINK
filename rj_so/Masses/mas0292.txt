THE STORMY STAR

The stormy star of freedom 
	Sits steadfast in the sky; 
Its light shakes not nor falters 
	While clouds go pouring by.

Poised in the topmost zenith
	It beckons from afar; 
Kings climb in vain against it
	With ridge on ridge of war....

And though all banners claim it
	And rumors fill the night - 
It knows no flag of battle,
	Its only voice is light.
