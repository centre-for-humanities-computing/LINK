ANY MAN TO ANY GOD

O God, I was a child but yester-
	day 
And now I am a man, my life half 
	spent, 
Outworn, and sick with fevered dis-
	content! 
I am with terror dumb, so short the 
	way 
That Thou hast given me from clay to 
	clay; 
My body is already sorely bent 
Because, through fault or malice, Thou
	hast blent 
My tissues so their function is decay.

O - God, if Thou didst "in Thy wis-
	dom plan"
This Universe of which I am a part, 
If Thou didst really work with con-
	scious art, 
Great God, I pity Thee! May never 
	man 
Reach in his quest for immortality 
Thy overpowering lust for misery!
