GRAY OLD MOTHER

Gray old mother with the sun-worn face, 
Seek ye your fine lad in this torn place? 
Nay, he is yonder where ye will not find him, 
Best forget him, mother, better never mind him,

Yes, I saw him pass with a swinging shoulder, 
Scarcely could the lad be one week older; 
Then my husband left me, left his babe behind him, 
Best forget him, mother, better never mind him.

Now the baby wakens crying in his sleep, 
They say that graves in Flanders are barely two feet deep; 
You've no baby, mother, and you'll never find him,
 Best forget him, mother, better never mind him.

Husbands may come home again . . . any likely lad 
Will make a man to cling to when the days grow bad; 
But your light-foot lad is gone, leaving you behind him,
Best forget him, mother, better never mind him.
