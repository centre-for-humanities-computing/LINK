THE LAUREATE

I am the poet laureate, 
	I celebrate the king;
I say 'tis not his fault he is 
	A petty, paltry thing.

He did not build his Majesty, 
	'Twas handed him at birth;That's why it is so vaporish. 
	So gassy vast of girth.Nor was the fault his mother's, 
	She did not make the plan;For who would get a wind-egg, 
	When she could sret a man?Lay not the blame on royalty, 
	Or on the blood that's blue;Believe the poet laureate, 
	The king's as good as you!As you that build his Majesty, 
	And bloat its pulpy face,You water-blooded supplejacks 
	That knuckle to his grace.I'd rather be his embryo, 
	Marked futile in the womb,Than be the slaves that fat him
	 And perpetuate his doom.I am the poet laureate, 
	I am not one that singsOf any fell decoction	To stop the hearts of kings,Or thinks it wants a scavenger,	With vitriolic fire, 
To purge the earth of royalty
	 And all the regal mire.I sing the sacred wonder 
	That kings are human still;Though poisoned through the ages. 
	Though sterilized of will,Denatured, puffed, perverted	With vapidness of lies -  
They still have looking faces - 	A light is in their eyes.It proves the sovereign urge of life,	Divine impulsive power, 
That gave his blood to any man.	Or brought him to his hour.If you would only strip them,
	 And whip them out-of-doors.'Twould need no fell decoction -  
	A king could do the chores.
