CIVILIZATION

Why do I sing a civilization that martyrs singers? 
Think you I am a traitor to the queen of song, 
	a spy within the realm of?
No'
Tis because its hands, gnarled with toil, have bandaged
	with a bloody rag the wounds of many; 
Because its face, sotted and seamed, offers still some
	kindling for the dying soul; 
Because its breath, thick with discord, is also hot with
	wrath over the murdered beauty of the world; 
Because its shoulders, knotted and bowed down, hold
	yet the strength to lift the world up; 
Because its breasts, shriveled and shrunk to a scar,
	still have milk roots that can swell with joy; 
Because its smile, crucified within the heart, lies waiting
	for the resurrection day: - 
That's why I sing a civilization that martyrs singers. 
Oh, I am no traitor to the queen of song.
