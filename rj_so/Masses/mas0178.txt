POSSESSION

I hold you fast; your hurrying 
	breath,Your wandering feet, your restless 
	heart,Are mine alone - for only death	You vowed today, shall make us part.

Your eager lips, athirst to drain 
	Life's goblet of its golden wineShall drink tonight, or thirst in vain -  
	I hold you fast, for you are mine.

And when I search your soul, until 
	I see too deeply, and divineThat you can never love me - still 
	I hold your fast - for you are mine!
