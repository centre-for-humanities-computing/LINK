SPRING!

HEY, old world, old lazy-bones, wake to the Spring-
	tune!
The music of the spheres is quickened to a jig - 
Wobble a one-step along your flashing orbit, with the
moon for your light-tripping partner!

Shove your staid bonnet over your ear, proper old lady, 
And sway along the streets, tipsy with the Spring!

Here are the young men, gay in their festive lids, 
Carolling vigorously the joy within them! 
What matter if the tune slide up and down? 
Spring is alive, and the maidens tremble to you, as you 
	to them.

I thrill with it too -
I long to hie me to His Honor the Mayor,
And slap him vigorously on the back, disturbing the
	proper set of his derby, 
And shout, Wake up, old chap, it's Spring!

Let the solemn judge shrug off the ermine, and join 
	the revellers!
Let the pompous financier sing a naughty trio with his
	wife and the placid chaffeur! 
And this to the Police Commissioner - 
Furnish the foremost pair of your marching guardians
	of the peace with mandolins and guitars, 
And let the ranks behind decorously do the toe dance.

Oh, the quickening of the world!
The push of the agile leaves, the fluttering mating of
	 birds,
The delicious unquiet of the love-hungry earth! 
The awakening spirit is everywhere; 
Nothing escapes ; nothing can resist dancing to its ab-
	surd and delightful melody.
