CARLOTTA, WHO MUST DIE, TO HER BODY

Oh, how can I leave you, Little 
	White Body! 
Little Friend Body! 
Like a silver fish you have slipped
	through the water! 
Like a hound have you leaped the 
	hedges!
Like a bird have you lifted your
	lovely head 
And sung, sung, sung to the Great
	Round Sun! 
Oh, Little White Body, must I leave 
	you?
