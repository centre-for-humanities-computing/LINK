TAKING OFF THE BANDAGE

	"Do not take the bandage off your eyes!" shout the pigmy retainers of Capitalism to the Giant Worker. 
	"It is irreligious and blasphemous," chants the black-robed anesthetician of the church. 
	"The sunlight is bad for your eyes," yowls the professor of pseudo-science. 
	"It is forbidden by the Constitution that: you should see," bellows the learned jurist. 
	"You never have seen and you never will see," caterwauls the eminent journalist. 
	"Irreligious, dangerous, forbidden, impossible!" shriek the full pack of pigmy hired men, priest and professor, jurist and journalist. 		Nevertheless, the Worker is taking the bandage off his eyes!
