APPEAL

Dear God, send me Nietzsche - 
Moustache and all,Bad breath, stomach ache, narcotics,
And grouch: - he's been telling me
Stuff that sticks
In my memory.
That is, I've been reading
Those paragraph piles
He called books.
And I like his hierarchy,
Because, of course,
I'd belong on top - a marquis
Of the intellect.
I wish he'd come back for
A day or two to inspect
Things he hadn't seen when
He wrote, "A good war halloweth
Any cause!" Supermen
And Will to Power! - 
I'd show him ten thousand
Bridges to the superman
Gone in an hour!
And "peace is a means to new wars!"
So said Nietzsche: - 
Never having heard the roars
Of trinitotoluol; never having seen
A clerk, "sick and botched," - 
In-bred, siphilitic, stupid, -
Kill one thousand healthy ones - 
By turning a crank!
The wisest of all,
And the stupidest, - 
Nietzsche, defier of the abyss,
I tell you this:
What you said of Christ
Is true of Nietzsche! . . .
Had you lived till now,
YOU would have dared to disavow!
No doubt, Nietzsche,
As you toast in Hell,
Their favorite torment for you
Is to tell
How we Socialists, followers of the 
Jew.
Hug "Thus Spake Zarathustra," 
To our hearts, 
Laughing at those parts 
In which you disown us.
