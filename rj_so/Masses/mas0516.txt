WEATHER

I tripped on black shadows, 
	The clouds began to freeze;
The air was angry with me, 
	I caught among the trees.

The air was full of spears 
	And whirled them in my eyes
Till I grew blind and lost:
	The shrill winds drowned my cries.

The shrill winds snatched my thoughts
	And whipped them about; 
The air was angry with me,
	My thoughts went out.

The pathways all were sullen,
	None would lead on. 
The snow tangled my breath;
	The pathways were gone.
