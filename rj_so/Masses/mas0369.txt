QUIET

The day ends,And all the petty, useless things
	that have chained me to my desk 
	during the long hours 
Drop from me like shackles, and I go 
	in search of you;And across some little corner table with 
	its heavy linen and gleaming silver, 
You touch my hand; and for a little 
	spaceYour gentle, soft-caressing, tender voice 
Brings me the quiet that I long for.
