AUTUMN SONG

A little song I tried to sing upon a summer's 
	day;
A song that turned a traitor, an air that used me 
	wrong - 
It minded me of springtime and the happy, happy way 
	When I was a young thing I sang the selfsame song.

I looked at my old hands, I harked to my old voice - 
	(Oh, voice that was, the song was different then!) 
I minded how the yellow sunlight made my heart 
	rejoice
When I was a young thing and unbeknown to men.
