THOROUGHLY PAGAN

A bourgeois lady told me 
That hers was a pagan mind. . . . 
That she loved to dream of dryads 
Dancing through autumnal forests, 
Of weak sexless men, 
Of powerful brutes in satin, 
And of serious-faced monkeys, on gilded 
	chairs, in boudoirs decorated in Chi-
	nese red, 
Listening to the music of flutes.
