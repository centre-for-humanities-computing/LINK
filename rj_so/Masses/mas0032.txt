THE NEW AMERICA

My Country! Now for thee, 
Sweet land that shalt be free,	New hope I sing. 
Land of the fathers' pride, 
Land for which Lincoln died, 
From every mountain-side	Shall Freedom ring.

For thee there dawns new day; 
From hoary Mammon's sway	Thou shalt be freed. 
No more shall man crush man, 
Nor use of God's world ban, 
For all shall toil by plan	For mankind's need.

Our darkened footsteps grope, 
And still postpone, the hope	Of that fair day: 
God send us power of sight, 
Then grant us will and, might, 
By Freedom's holy light	To hew our way.Our strength we will not spare, 
Nor cease to do and dare,	For thee, loved land! 
Then, when the task is done, 
Oh, 'neath the rising sun, 
Thy, children, all as one,	Comrades shall stand.
