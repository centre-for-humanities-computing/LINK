GOLDEN BOUGH

Let it not be, love, underneath a roof,
	Closed in with furniture, and four walls 
		round; 
But we will find a place wild, far aloof,
	Our room the woods, our bed the sweet-
		smelled ground.

There at the soft foot of some friendly tree 
	With grass and leaves and flowers we will lie
Where all is wide and beautiful and free -  
	Free as when love first loved beneath the sky.

No lock or curtain need we in the shade
	 And silence of the forest's inmost fold:
And none save us shall know where we are laid 
	Or guess what nuptial day those woodlands 
		hold.

There fitly may we bring our loves to greet 
	That ancient love, more old than wind or
		 sod;
Fitly where beasts and flowers wed shall meet
	Our lips, our limbs, beneath the look of God.
