LIES

Along the gaslit Boulevard 
	Under the shadow-spreading trees 
		They walk, the slender silhouettes, 
Night-hidden, but for outlines hard, 
	Slow-stepping, wanly mad to please, 
		While, heart-deep, endless Hunger frets.

Or, choked, that hunger long is dead,	Or, unborn, died before its bliss. 
		The curve of feather and of eyes, 
Their hot light calling to the bed - 	The breasts borne temptingly to kiss -  
Of what Truth are these things the lies.?
