'TIS OF THEE

There was a wench in our town,	She was a poor wage slave; 
Her son, her only pride and joy,	He was a soldier brave.

One day the mother went on strike - 	What did the brave boy do? 
He took his Governmental Gun	And shot his Ma in two.

And when he saw his Ma was dead,	That toiling Ma of his'n, 
He heaved a sigh, and shed a tear,	And said, "Well - 't's Patriotism."
