WELFARE SONG

Sing a song of "Welfare," 
	A pocket full of tricks 
To soothe the weary worker
	When he groans or kicks. 
If he asks for shorter hours
	Or for better pay,
Little stunts of "Welfare"
	Turn his thoughts away.

Sing a song of "Welfare,"
	Sound the horn and drum, 
Anything to keep the mind
	Fixed on Kingdom Come. 
"Welfare" loots your pocket
	While you dream and sing, 
"Welfare" to your pay check
	Doesn't do a thing.

Sing a song of "Welfare,"
	Forty 'leven kinds, 
Elevate your morals,
	Cultivate your minds. 
Kindergartens, nurses,
	Bathtubs, books, and flowers, 
Anything but better pay
	Or shorter working hours.
