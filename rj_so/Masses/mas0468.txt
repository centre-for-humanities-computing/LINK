THE COMING

There must be golden poppies when my love 
	comes - 
Golden poppies in the west-wind, and lupines ocean-
	blue;
And purple grass-nuts pushing up between green 
	ferns
Delicate as the green sea's foam; 
And on the burnished sand the strange mesembry-
	anthemum,
That seems to move and crawl and sway like sea-
	anemones
Whose violet and rose and red fill tide-pools with
	unearthly beauty, 
Who move slowly and rhythmically under the green
	tide-pools.
There must be sweet warm light of the sun; 
And a ceaseless wind from the sea, 
And the moon to whisper us to sleep.
