TO A WAR POET

You sang the battle - 
Boldly you called for the muskets to rattle,
You, in your slippered ease.
And bade the bugles lift to the breeze.
Glory you sang - from your couch -
With a weak and sagging pouch 
You uttered your militant prattle -
You sang the battle!

What was your singing for,
With its two-penny craving for gore;
With its blatant and shoddy glamor 
False to the core?
Evil enough is the poisonous clamor -
Why should you yammer 
Of war?

Safe in your club or your den 
You watch them go past you again;
Other than when you first sung them,
(Thankful that you‚Äôre not among them)
Soldiers no longer, but men.
Men - and young boys - who were hot with the breath 
Of your ardor and noisy ferment -
Look at them now; they are broken and spent. . . 
Are you not glad that your doggerel sent 
Hundreds of these to their death?

Go now - stop clearing your throat;
Drop those fat hands that smote
Your twanging and trumpery lute.
Go now - and learn from that battered recruit 
Of his jubilant sixty days!
Of the horror that crowded the dawn;
Of a fragrant and peace-breathing lawn 
Turned to a roaring blaze;
Of frantic drums that blustered and beat 
A nightmare retreat;
Of the sickness, the death-dealing stenches;
Of the blundering fight through the sleet 
Waist-high in the water-filled trenches
.Of women ravished in a gust 
Of horrible, hasty lust;
And children conceived with the crippling weight 
Of frenzied and cancerous hate. . .
The dusk settling down like a blight,
Screening unnamable hordes;	
Searchlights stabbing the night 
With blinding and bodiless swords;
Of a sudden welter of cries 
And death dropping down from the skies. . .
What was your singing for?
This music that dared to enamor 
The crowd with the clamor 
It could not ignore. . .	
Go - with your falsetto roar;
Go - with your ready-made glamor.
Why should you stay here to gurgle and stammer 
Of war?
