TO AN OLD MAN

Terror you bring into this room;
	Your smile and cheerful mien are lies,
	There is no youth within your eyes,
And though your cheeks still bravely bloom 
You are in league with death and doom; 
	Therefore you come with laughter bright,
	With wine and flowers of the night 
And flashing in a fool's costume.

We hate the jest upon your tongue,
	The merriment of your glad song,
	Your happiness will do us wrong,
Who, unlike you, are really young,
You stifle us, who have not sung,
	And when you dance with ease and grace 
	There is a look upon your face 
That leaves us shaken and unstrung.

The words you say are fine and sweet,
	And every step you take is sure,
	And seemingly you shall endure 
When we are dust within the deep.
You walk erect while still we creep.
	No blunders mar your perfect parts - 
	Master you are of human hearts,
And yet with evilness replete.

Such wit as yours we cannot spin,
	Nor so much kindness show to man,
	And with such delicacy span 
The awkward breach 'twixt right and sin.
But still you lose, who always win,
	And in the moment of your gain 
	We mark the poignant rush of pain 
That makes your victory harsh and thin.

You are a ghost by Time begot,
	You are a thing that should not be.
	Startled at times we sharply see 
Ourselves in your exquisite rot.
Some day we, too, shall share your lot 
	And be so faultless and bizarre,
	The sheen of some soft silver star,
Whose light lives on, though it is out.
