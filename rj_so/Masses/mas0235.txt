AFTER THE STRIKE

Bring your young courage and the white resolve that puts all 
	fear aside:
Bring your loud bantering and your crowd valor, 
Your thin and borrowed gift of threatening the foe: 
Bring your high tenet of Democracy, 
And look on this.
This man and woman kissing through the bars of a jail gate;
This man who clothed you with vision and with power,
Who made the weakest brother one with the strong,
Whose speech, practical and prophetic, filled the streets with
	clamor for the common good, 
Who put tongues that spoke for freedom into your silent heads, 
And made speech, winged for war with Mammon, to fill each
	silent mouth - 
Behold this man, essence of your purpose and your wish, 
Stand calm, unbroken and uncowed behind this jail gate: 
And look upon this woman 
Smiling with her uncomplaining eyes. 
Come and behold
And see them kiss through the bars of this jail gate.
