DESIRES

My heart is full of desires! 
Desires that patter across it 
Like the fleet footsteps of dancers, 
Whirling, changing, and mingling 
Their pretty caperings hurt me, 
But not so much as the pain 
That will some day come to me, 
When my heart is still and grass grown, 
And desires have ceased their dancing.
