THE DEAR LITTLE BULLET

How dear to my heart are the scenes of the 
		attle,
	As every good soldier should find them to be! 
How sweet to my ears is the musical rattle
	Of the enemy's guns as he trains them on me! 
But of all the delights that I have in full measure - 
	Though of wounds my idea is still rather vague -  
I think it would be the most exquisite pleasure
	To be shot by the bullet approved by The Hague. 
The neat little bullet, the clean-wounding bullet,
	Humane little bullet approved by The Hague.

How sweet in a non-vital part to receive it -  
	You're certain to live if they don't strike you 
		dead!
It seems so delightful I scarce can believe it -  
	(Is it safer to stand on my feet or my head?)
And when I'm removed from this loved situation 
	Where the enemy now I so gleefully plague,
I surely will find it a full compensation
	To be killed by the bullet approved by The 
		Hague.
The neat little bullet, the clean-wounding bullet, 
	The dear little bullet approved by The Hague.
