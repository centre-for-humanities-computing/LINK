AUTUMN LIGHT

So bright and soft is the sweet air of morning, 
And so tenderly the light descends, 
And blesses with its gentle-falling fingers 
All the leaves unto the valley's ends - 

It brings them all to being when it touches 
With its paleness every glowing vein; 
The wild and flaming hollows of the forest 
Kindle all their crimson in its rain;

And every curve receives its share of morning, 
Every little shadow softly grows, 
And motion finds a melody more tender 
That like a phantom through the branches goes - 

So bright and soft and tranquil-rendering, 
And quiet in its giving, as though love, 
The sacred dream of life, were born of morning, 
And really poured its being from above.
