ANOTHER POEM

You were asking me for a poem for your readers, W
	hen you were standing out on the street gay
		 and hearty,
All ready to go for a walk in the park with your
	 sweetheart,
As I passed on my way to my job on the newspaper.

On my way coming home at three in the morning, 
I was stopped there by the wreck of a woman, 
Right where you stood on the street in the sunshine 
All ready to go for a walk in the park with your 
	sweetheart.

Honest to God, I gave her the hail in the lamplight 
And bought her a rammer of rum in the saloon on the
	corner.
I planked half a dollar down on the bar. 
The bartender pitched it into the till with the bishops. 
I gave the old jade the change (three dimes and a 
	nickel).
As I bade her good-bye I heard the cop's eye, like a
	weasel's,  
Saying as plain as if he were shouting, 
"There's a young fool that is taking his chances." 
(Dear man, that cop's eye was thinking of Hell).

Now speaking of poetry, this ain't what people call 
	pretty,
 But I think it worthy of notice.
