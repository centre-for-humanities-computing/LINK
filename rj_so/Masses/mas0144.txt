TOP O' THE POT

I has an old grandam and she was blind,
And she had lived from time out of mind.
And she knew all the sage old saws
That ever were known since the gray world was.

And when she heard one who vaunted himself
Of his pedigree's length or the pride of his pelf,
Then with a wag of her knowing head,
"The top o' the pot is the scum," she said.

The edge of her tongue was a thing to fear;
Heedless she was who might hear.
"He thinks he's God; and Who but He!
But the top o' the pot is the scum," said she.
