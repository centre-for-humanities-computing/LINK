ILLUMINATION

My sad moments are never my best.
People like me 
And I like myself 
Better
When I am fully illuminated, 
Lit up,
A candle in every window of my house.
I will not draw the blinds of my soul
Or put out the lights.
I will go around lighting them all,
Trimming the wicks,
Putting new candles in place of old,
Keeping every light burning.
