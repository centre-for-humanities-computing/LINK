THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER

We are the dead, sprung fresh, 
	A thousand times at your call. 
We are the quick, whose flesh
	You have builded into your wall.

Not as your soldiers die,
	Have we poured life's votive stream; 
We have given it, sigh by sigh,
	 We have given it, dream by dream.

We have given the hope that dies, 
	When the last of youth departs;
e have given the light of our eyes, 
	And the song that lived in our hearts.

Our hands to the task are true, 
	Though our hearts, at length, are dead.
We have given our souls to you; 
	O City, give us our bread!
