THE MASQUERADER

Who is this tall Incognito,	Bravely attended? 
Singing boys before him go, 
And fifes and trumpets blare and blow	Loud, proud and splendid. 
Before his helmet richly bossed
	Folk kneel in honor; - 
Beneath his feather brightly tossed	And gold-fringed banner.       
Have all the peoples, at his word,	(Mother by mother) 
Sent the bravest of their brave, 
With that large knife they call the sword,	To wound each other, 
And thrust into the quicklime grave 
The stained and splintered bones abhorred
	Of son and brother?

I hear the revel master call	For the unmasking. 
Trembles the masquerader tall? 
Leans he faint against the wall,	Vain respite asking? T
he steady voice is heard once more: 
"Unmask the face of war."

Naked now at last he stands	Of pomp and splendor.  
The golden eagles, blare of bands, 
The singing and the waving hands.	No mere, Pretender! 
(Hide, hide with decent grace
	His shamed confusion, 
His poor, blank, idiot face
	And dead illusion).
