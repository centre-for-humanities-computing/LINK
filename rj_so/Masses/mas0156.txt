A RHYME FOR THE SWINE

Swine, Swine, Swine,
Wallowing, swallowing swine, 
How they slosh in the swill 
That the farmer doth spill 
In the pen that is south of the hill.

See! see! The Big Pig
Was asleep in the sun;
Now he comes on the run!
Thrusts a flexible snout
Through the wallowing herd - 
Shoves the others aside from the succulent swill!
Puts his feet in the trough, gives a squeal and a cough,
And wallows and swallows and gobbles his fill!
