IN THE OUTER SANCTUM

There they sat, poor devils in the long rose-lighted 
	room.
They gazed upon the pictures and green draperies 
And the gold draped picture of the mother and child 
That gave the room such air of sanctity.

They waited for the Magazine Editor.

The young girl pensive in a tiger-coat fondling the pic-
	ture of a kitten drawn for a spring cover,
Thinking she might get the price of a summer frock
	for it - 

And the old woman with the pale face and deep lines: 
She was so sedate in her fur trimmed cape with her 
	hands folded.
Under her livery she is a nun mumbling her litany of 
	sentiment
And bringing her offering to the Editor. 
She has written a cold respectable kiss after each tenth 
	sentiment. 

The nice young man in a green cravat is hopeful.
(He belongs to the Editor's College Frat.)
He will see his name on the front page in three months.

Outside, the patient aching world goes shuffling by.
