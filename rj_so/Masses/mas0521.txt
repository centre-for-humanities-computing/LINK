TIME

The clock,
Hush!
One. Two. Three.
Three-quarters.
It is only a moment ago - 
Hardly a moment - 
Since the half-hour struck:
Not time enough for doing anything - 
Except to lie here happy in the dark, - 
And yet, how many minutes have gone by:
Pieces from the existence of our lives.

O, clock, clock,
Do you go eating away the hours like this
All the night long?
And all the day-time,
When we are too busy to know,
Are they trickling, trickling, trickling away, so fast?

Clock,
You are taking our lives. 
You are eating them away. 
Moment by moment, 
Quickly,
You will drink them up, 
Until all our moments are gone; 
Until our lives are done, 
And our love is done.

One. Two. Three. Four.
