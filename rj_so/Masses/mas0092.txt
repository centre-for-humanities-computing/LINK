THE SWIMMER'S SONG

All day the cool waters
Run smoothly for the swimmer, 
With little leaves floating 
And little green fishes; 
And wonderful pebbles 
In the bed of the stream.

But at night the wind rises 
And the red leaves are drowned, 
And pebbles grate and drift 
In the current of the waters, 
And the happy feet 
Of the swimmer are gone.
