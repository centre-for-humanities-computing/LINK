REVOLUTION

Anyone can write Revolution - Revolution 
	is written
By pale young men with the new conven-
	tional mind;
Though it causes, indeed, no such havoc 'mid 
	humankind
As Samson's did when the Philistines were 
	smitten.

It is easy to preach Revolution - Revolution 
	in pink reviews,
Or flourish a Phrygian cap from the top of a 
	steeple:
But if ever it came to an uprising of the people,
How many pale poets would stand in the 
	leaders' shoes?
