THE SOUND OF THE NEEDLES

I too, hold the knitting in my hand, 
But my needles are still - 
I am listening, listening to the sound 
That other women's needles make.

		I
How quietly the women sit -
Do they count stitches as they knit?
	Click, click, click, click. 
Do women count the dead that fall? 
Did that one hear a dead man call?
	Click, click, click, click.

For every stitch a man laid low, 
And sixty stitches in a row - 
How fast the women's needles go!

		II
What marching time the needles keep! 
Will dead men hear that sound and sleep?
	Click, click, click, click. 
Can sophistry of court or king 
Shout down the song the needles sing
	?Click, click, click, click.

For every stitch a man lies dead - 
But that is not the sound I dread, 
The steady dropping of the lead.

		III
Citoyens, aux armes! aux armies! 
Do women sound that dread alarm?
	Click, click, click, click. 
Will deathcarts rumble on the ground? 
Will women knitting near be found?
	Click, click, click, click.

Do murderous thoughts like molten ore 
Through ravaged brains and bodies pour? 
They count aloud - "one, two, three, four."
