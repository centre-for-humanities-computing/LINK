RAVELLING

Now let me unknit my life away from yours: 
	So closely, So tightly, 
In so perplexed a pattern are they knitted to-
	gether; 
Stitch with stitch, 
Thread with thread; 
Twisted over and under - 
O seamless. . . . 
Though with knives we rend and tear,
We must unknit those strands;
Those intertwining,
Those soft tight-woven fibers,
That tangle and cling - 
Now we will unknit those strands.
