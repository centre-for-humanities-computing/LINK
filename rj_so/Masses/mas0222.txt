PRAYER AT THE END OF THE DAY'S WORK

I believe in Life: in the honor of being born; in the glory of dying. 
I believe in the Work of Life: the everlasting Struggle to Know, 
	with its continual Victories and its unending Defeat.

I believe in the Joy of Life, believe that some day it will be more 
	than bitter foam and dregs.

And I believe in the Substance of Life - in Man - in the Ape that
	Was - in the Gods to Be. Amen.
