REWARD ON EARTH

Perry Carterel saw fays and 
	fairies 
Dancing naked in his water basin; 
Perry wrote a poem telling of it, 
Snubbed his wife, and won undying 
	fame. 

Taliswami cultivated spirits, 
Communicated with them fluently; 
Tali sold his knowledge to the world 
And in return embraced a banker's 
	daughter. 
Silas Martin saw a host of angels 
Drinking cider in his apple orchard; 
Silas, gratis, told it to the preacher 
And consequently was incarcerated.
