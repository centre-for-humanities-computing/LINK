NOT YEARS

Not years, not the close dear daily living, not the sweet 
	savor
Of life, I ask of you; nor the flavor
Of day-by-day; nor hand covering hand without haste; 
(These are to others; these we shall not taste.) 
But surely, maybe silently, before age overtake us,
Before the sweet firm strength of our bodies is laid waste, -  
Two days or three
Without question, without past, without future, 
Somewhere in the hills, somewhere in sight of the sea.
