THE SHADOW-CHILD

Deep in the shrine of my heart there sits
	White as the driven snow, 
The drooping form of a little child, 
	Sobbing - sobbing low.

Oh! he breaks my heart with his sweet soft limbs,
	And the curve of his neck is pain, 
As he bows to the storm of my drenching grief
	Like a bud in the summer rain.

Fruit of my spirit - Shadow-babe
	Dwelling within my heart, 
I dread the day, should it ever come,
	When he and I must part.

The crown of Life is not for me,
	It would wither at my touch, 
For I am among the conquered - 
	And the crown is not for such.

I know the joy of living,
	I know what Love is worth -  
And I only long to lay my limbs
	To rest in the quiet earth.

And I pray to Christ it may never come,
	The day of my baby's birth. 
That the gift of grief my Mother gave
	May be buried with me in the Earth.
