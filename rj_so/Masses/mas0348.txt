TO A MAD DOG

Almost!
You inconceivably almighty bitch, 
You almost had me at the sewer ditch! 
One more briar in that snaky wall, 
And I'd be fertilizer‚Äîpoems and all! 
Yes - race your snout around the ladder, 
You foaming whelp, you legged adder, 
You just half guess that a passing jog, 
A slippery scantling - you blue mangey dog! - 
Would swing my soul to the eternal fog! 
What's this we live in? Is this a world? 
Just let me ponder‚Äîmy legs are curled: 
If you could leap as a greyhound can, 
If I'd been a ten year older man, 
If you hadn't dodged at the apple tree -  
Why, any old if, and with wiry glee
You'd nip the life and the light from me! 
From me, a power, and a poet, too! 
Gods of the world! And who are you? 
A low-lived, loitering neighbor's pup 
I kick off the stoop when I first get up!
