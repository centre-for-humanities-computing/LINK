THE HARVEST MOON

Summer has given me only vinegar. 
Moon, Moon, sweeten my cup! 
Summer has buried me in the trenches. 
Moon, Moon, lift me up! 
Blot out the emptiness of noon 
With dreams of beauty, Harvest Moon! 

Lovely! Fools' gold is gold in my 
	fingers, 
And the night air is sparkling purple 
	wine;                
And who is this that mocks the counter-
	sign 
Yet safely steals to my side and lingers 
A pillow to my loneliness, as tender 
As spring, as fragrant, warmer yet
	 moonlight cool, 
And makes a lover of a warring fool, 
And life most glorious, most glad in 
	surrender? 

Autumn has opened to me her vineyard. 
Moon, Moon, you have sweetened my 
	cup! 
Autumn has raised me high as Heaven. 
Moon, Moon, you have lifted me up! 
You have blotted out the emptiness of
	noon                                
With dreams of beauty, Harvest Moon!
