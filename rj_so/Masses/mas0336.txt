ANARCH

I escape from all th em that hold me; 
The prisons and the strong stockades of love, 
The deep pits of hatred let me go. 
I pass on perforce from name to name, 
Assume new qualities and titles 
Sewed and patched on for the day's need 
From old definiti ons proudly fitting once, 
But soiled, rent and tawdry long since 
Like the heaped regalia of long unfashionable kings. 
I pass on, escape even from myself. 
The swiftest mood and widest embracing thought 
Reel from my eager tortuous progression. 
Nay, the whole world grins 
Knowingly from its mask of good and evil;
 Murderers, in utmost pity, droop before their judge, 
And for the sake of the world's masquerade 
Dive willingly into the black mud of stigma.Otherwise - But we are all anarchistsStumbling brave and blind through a strange lost region 
Bordering the stupendous ecstasy of life.
