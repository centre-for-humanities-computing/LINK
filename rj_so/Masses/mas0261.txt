PEACE

The peace of indifference! 
The boon of love that wanes! 
The calm of muscles that let go -  
The ceasing of children crying! 
Stems that yield and break, 
Stems that withstand no longer . . . 
The lulling of billows to ripples, 
Wet to the burn of the sun on tender 
	flesh;The caress of cool moss to parched feet. 
The monotonous singing of wind that	blows nowhere - 
The murmur of wind that lazes of de-
	struction - 
The idleness of music that strays, 
The ease of smiles that yield nothing, 
The grace of interest that relinquishes, 
The lightness of love that weighs little, 
The lightness of lightened love -  
The stilly cool of nothing 
After love that burns!
