RETURN

Sometimes,
When we are quiet together,
Full of love,
Contented,
With hearts far off from speech, -  

Then sometimes,
Strange soft noises begin to come through our lips:
Breathing from us
Out of our throats:
Murmurings that make no words,
And yet they have a meaning more than words.

Do you think it might be
These sounds are ancient sounds?
Out of the ages long ago,
When a lover's talk was only noises,
Before men spoke in words?
And now today,
We, who own many words,
Return to this first crooning for a speech:
Letting love stir its own sounds in our throats:
Content to use a language inarticulate;
Old as the neighing and whimpered cries of the beasts.
