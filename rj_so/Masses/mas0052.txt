DOWNWARD

Somber green and gold-vermilion flashes
	Of swift fins and tails; strange dim red coral trees 
And the pale-bellied fishes that glide through the sea-
	forests;
Dank gardens, why does my soul turn to you
 After the hot and sunlit heights of the mountains? 
All the days are alike, all the nights are unchanging. 
Time is not, and dawn and dark are unheeded 
Where the only light is the green and deep infiltration 
slow-moving, drowned, dead.
Bosoms green and clothed in the long-woven sea-slime, 
Narrow eyes, round eyes, cold and myriad, gleaming
	without passion, without feeling; 
Clasping fins, a cold love that is voracity, 
A love without interest, inevitable, slow, like the rythm
	of the tides,
Without volition, a rythm, like weed swaying in the 
	tides,
Even a love like this I crave, who have known the
	swift searing flame,
 The merciless consuming of the soul, the weak and
	delirious ardor 
That we whose veins are hot call love. 
O sea-swell, O slow-enchaining, pallid enchantment 
Draw me down in the depths; and when it is over 
This sold and emerald episode, then devour me -  
That all remaining is coral,
Pearl, curved shell, green weed, or a whirling current.
