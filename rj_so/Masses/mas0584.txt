CONTRADICTIONS

If Death would only come in passion's 
	guise 
And claim my longing soul with pant-
	ing breath 
Like lover's lips, 'neath sultry, moonlit 
	skies, 
I'd go with Death. 

But Death, uncaring, pitiless and stern, 
Repels my shivering soul, that quails at 
	fate -  
Till, for its mad insistence, back I turn 
	Toward Life I hate!
