CIVILIZATION

Civilization!
Everybody kind and gentle, and men giving up their seats 
	in the car for the women . . . 
What an ideal! 
How bracing!

Is this what we want?
Have so many generations lived and died for this?
There have been Crusades, persecutions, wars, and majestic arts,
There have been murders and passions and horrors since man
	was in the jungle. . .  
What was this blood-toll for?
Just so that everybody could have a full belly and be well-
	mannered?

But let us not fool ourselves:
This civilization is mostly varnish very thinly laid on . . . 
Take any newspaper any morning: scan through it . . .
 Rape, murder, villany, and picking and stealing: 
The mob that tore a negro to pieces, the men that ravished a 
	young girl:

The safe-blowing gang and the fat cowardly promoter who stole
	people's savings. . .  
Just scan it through: this news of civilization . . .

Away then, with soft ideals:
Brace yourself with bitterness:
A drink of that biting liquor, the Truth. . . 

Let us not be afraid of ourselves, but face ourselves and con-
	fess what we are:
Let us go backward a while that we may go forward:
This is an excellent age for insurrection, revolt, and the reddest
	of revolution. . .
