A QUESTION

Did you ever lie in a man's arms
And hate him;
 And get up in the morning and do your
	work 
And hate it;
And mend your children's clothes 
And look out across the front lawn 
And wonder dully what you'd get for 
	lunch?

Did you ever walk along the boulevard
On a hot afternoon
Wheeling a baby, - 
A pretty golden haired baby
That you'd like to paint
But couldn't,
And it cried and had to be fed, 
And you hated it?

Did you ever serve a dinner to a silent 
	man 
Reading a paper; 
And after washing up the dishes 
Sit alone and twist your wedding ring 
And hate it:

And plan your next day's work while
	taking down your unkept hair, 
And wonder why you looked so old and
	wrinkled and so bent 
At thirty?

And did you ever go to bed and wait, -  
	and wait -  
And dread the arms you waited for, -  
Those hot and selfish arms of the man
	you lived with, 
Cooked for, claimed to love -  
And hated?
