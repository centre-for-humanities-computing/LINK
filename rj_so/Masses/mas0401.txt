FROM A STATISTICAL CLERK

Little black figures in rows,
Little crooked black figures. 
Numberless columns 
To add,
To distribute in square little spaces.
Strutting black insects, 
Imposters
Who juggle our tragedies.
"Vital statistics!"
Marriages,
Babies dead,
Broken lives,
Men gone mad,
Labor and crime
All treated in bulk with the tears wiped off,
Numbered
These are not real,
Nor the huge lie of Life
That is crushed down within me
Choked with dead words.
Nothing exists
But the little black figures
In rows.
Live things on a pin. 
Broken-backed,
Sprawling, with legs like flies, 
Reaching up out of the page as I gaze, 
Then cringing down thru the desk, 
Leering, malignant. 
I shut my eyes. 
Something - 
The murmur of stars high over my ceiling -  
No, only the swarming blackcreatures. 
Into my brain they press
 Down, down,
Till the world is spread out in a flickering black sheet 
With a green hedge.
