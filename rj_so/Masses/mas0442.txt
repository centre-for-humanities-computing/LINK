GOD'S ACRE

Because we felt there could not be
A mowing in reality 
So white and feathery-blown and gay, 
With blossoms of wild carroway, 
I said to Celia, "Let us trace 
The secret of this pleasant place!" 
We knew some deeper beauty lay 
Beneath the blooms of carroway; 
And when we brushed these blooms aside 
We came to paupers who had died: 
Rough wooden shingles row on row, 
And God's name written there - "John Doe."
