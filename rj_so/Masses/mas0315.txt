HOSTILITIES

"No hard feelings, I hope?" 
Oh, no, you wrinkled hag
 Over your teapot telling my associates 
The things I didn't want them to know 
	about me.

"No hard feelings, I hope?" 
Debonaire queen of liars, 
You who stir up envy against me 
And smile when I overhear you, 
You who talk down my pet schemes 
And make game of my princely fancies, 
Certainly not.

But as for you, street man
Who slugged me in the mouth and broke 
	two teeth 
Before I got my fingers to your throat, 
When we two walk out of the hospital
	together, 
You shall have my respect.
