"CHICK LORIMER"

Everybody loved Chick Lorimer in our 
	town.
		Far off 
	Everybody loved her.
So we all love a wild girl keeping a hold
		On a dream she wants. 
Nobody knows now where Chick Lor-
	imer went. 
Nobody knows why -she packed her
	trunk ... a few old things,
 And is gone,
		Gone with her little chin 
		Thrust ahead of her, 
		And her soft hair-blowing careless 
		From under a. white hat,
 Dancer, singer, a laughing, passionate 
	lover.

Were there ten men or a hundred hunt-
	ing Chick? 
Were there five men or fifty with ach-
	ing hearts?
		Everybody loved Chick Lorimer. 
		Nobody knows where she's gone.
