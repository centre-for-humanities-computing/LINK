HIGHWAYS

Who's learned the lure of trodden ways
	And walked them up and down, 
May love a steeple in a mist, 
	But cannot love a town.

Who's worn a bit of purple once
	Can never, never lie 
All smothered in a little box
	When stars are in the sky.

Who's sipped old port in Venice glass
	May thirst for better brew -  
He's drunk an amber wine of sun
	And wet his mouth with dew!

Who's ground the grist of trodden ways - 
	The gray dust and the brown -  
May love red tiling two miles off - 
	But cannot love a town.
