AND THOU, TOO, AMERICA?

We blaze at what the Teuton sword hath done,
And of the war, with cursing hearts, men say
"Above all other nations it was they, 
The armed, the well-prepared, who brought it on." 
Yet the same men of Congress ask anon 
For ships and troops a hasty, huge outlay,
While poor men's children still in gutters play, 
And poor men's lungs still rot for want of sun! 
Is this authentic? Will my country, then, 
Rather invest in tools for killing men 
Than save the little children of her poor? 
Speakest thou so, my country? Then be sure 
Thou in thy heart dost not so much condemn 
These German lords of war, as envy them.
