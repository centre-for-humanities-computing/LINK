THE DOUBLE-TWISTED CRAB

The double-twisted crab looked up 
	At the golden bars of Heaven -  
His wart-filled eyes knew more of grief
	 Than Devil's-Hades driven: 
He held a shovel in his hand	And the humps on his back were seven.

His clothes unwashed for many moons,	Strange odors did emit; 
The shoes that hung upon his feet	Were never meant to fit. 
His glances fell two ways at once - 	Being cross-eyed, opposite.

He seem'd he scarce had seen a day	That held out pleasant hours; 
Year after year he'd stumbled on	Beneath task-grinding powers -  
So blindly driven he longed to go	And rest beneath the flowers.

"I wish that I could enter there,"	He croaked in accents hoarse, 
"But Fate has no such store for me - 	My outfit is too coarse." 
And then the double-twisted crab	Shed tears - the poor old horse.
