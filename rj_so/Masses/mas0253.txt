IN WINTER

Sometimes I think with longing more like lust	Of Summer, and the feeling of hot days 
When the green trees are breathless, when white dust	Parches the clover by the roads, ablaze 
With late July; and the apparent heat	Twists the thick air in lines like wrinkled glass 
When, body stretched full length in the complete	Dispassionate enfolding of the grass 
One feels the Summer like a passion whose 
	Problem-suspended interval is dense 
	With such august phenomena as Birth, 
Death, and Decay, and the strained mind must lose 
	Its doubt, and in the splendid fact of sense
	Find reason for the being of the earth.
