WORDS

I put the blood of my heart 
And the sweat of my labor 
Into a line.

I look out over the mountains
And over the sea,
And am aware
Of the majesty of God,
And I write
A second line.

I look into my soul -  
Out of its agony, 
Out of its mortality, 
Its ceaseless question, 
Its inevitable ending, 
I fashion two lines.

After a while 
You read. 
I watch your eyes 
Travel down the page; 
They lighten, then cloud; 
I look over your shoulder -  
How is this? 
All I see
Are little black marks 
On white paper.
