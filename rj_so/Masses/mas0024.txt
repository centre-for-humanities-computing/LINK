A NOTICEABLE LACK OF HARMONY IN THE HOHENZOLLERN HOME

"You are old, Father William," the Crown Prince said, 
	"And your face has become quite a fright,
And yet you keep banging me over the head; 
	Do you think at my age it is right?"

"In your youth," Father William replied with a swat,
	"I feared it might injure your brain. 
But now that I know that a brain you have not,
	I'll do it again and again."
