"YOUNG LADS FIRST"

The grey-beards sat in the fateful room
Resolving an empire's certain doom, 
Statesmen shrewd and forum-tried, 
Heavy-paunched and crafty-eyed; 
The thing they plotted had come to pass
And Fate held up her looking-glass. 
Sage, they nodded their heads together, 
"War, my friends, is windy weather, 
Every bird has a nest to feather."

The young men laughed in the friendly sun, 
And shoulder to shoulder the work was done; 
Boyish-hearted they only knew 
That youth was good and friends were true, 
That girls were merry to have and hold, 
That the wisest men were always old, 
That honor was fair, and life was brave, 
A man's own country was his to save . . . 
I hear them laugh from the bitter grave.

The grey-beards from their councils came
To set the young men's ears aflame:
"Honor!" was the cry they flung,
For they were old, and the others young.
So . . . some young men called others foes,
And died death-grappled in stinking rows,
While the grey-beards nodded their heads together,
"War, my friends, is windy weather,
Every bird has a nest to feather."
