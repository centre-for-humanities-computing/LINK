WHAT OF THE NIGHT

Even yet they will not know it is war!Cripple Creek - Calumet - Trinidad - speak in vain. 
Yet though battles and blood should teach not, fain 
Were we to think they might read portents as plain 
As to the elder-world the terrible Blazing Star!

As when the heavens hang on the breathless verge of 
	storm,And even nerves of beasts are tense with the strain, 
So ere wars and tumults - throne-shattering Change - 
Ever the human emotions give the alarm, 
Breaking forth into forms grotesque and strange.

Then the warrior paints his skin and dances the dance 
	of death;Then the faith-frenzies rage, and the great brute throat 
	of lustLooses the roar and blast of his furnace-breath.

And though for better things the heart of mankind we 
	trust,We know not what comes on as the swift hours roll, 
Or whether it be but a step to the barricades in the 
	streetAnd sound of the grinding of swords and lilt of the 
	carmagnole. . . . If it comes with less or more of strife and blood, 
It will come - and beautiful on the hills its feet; 
It will come - the Day - with its light like a golden 
	flood,The Day to seers and singers of old made known, 
When Man, ah Man, at last shall come into his own.

Though the light of its splendorous rising I may not 
	hail,And little it be I know of fate's decrees, 
And little it be of trust in gods I know, 
Yet I know - the Morning cometh! It cannot fail. 
The great unresting tides that through Time's eternity 
	flow,The stars in their courses that ever do battle for these, 
And the ultimate Will of Man, will have it so.
