BIRTH

Sometimes in the hollow dark, 
Sometimes in the crowded day, 
Comes the memory of your room. 
The air, warm and faintly aromatic - 
The starched rustle of the nurse's gown - 
The hushed stir, the busy whispers - 
The wide bed, tightly folded in 
And your young body, gracious even in pain. 
Your head turned sideways on the pillow 
Was flushed and stern, 
The cords of your neck swelling 
Up under the edge of your soft brown hair. 
In that strained quiet
You seemed caught up in some vast, harmonious 
	rhythm,
Your limbs consenting dumbly to an unheard mark-
	ing of time; 
Attaining in your labor a grandeur of beauty 
That shamed your usual saucy prettiness. 
I longed then, I remember, for the heroic marble
That would hold this triumph immortal. 
You held hard to my hand.
Only your restless fingers were eloquent with pain. 
And I marvelled at your composure 
And dignity,
You - the petulant, spoiled child! 
Your lips moved soundlessly; 
Little drops of moisture beaded your forehead; 
Tiny tendrils of hair began to curl around your 
	brow;
And I remembered seeing it so on early summer 
	mornings
When we, two sisters, slept together.

At last your cry!
So sharp and smiting, and echoing like a call from a
	far place. 
And then, after a tense moment, 
Trembling on the turbulent warmth, 
Came the tentative whine of your child. 
Your hands loosened and I left the room,
Somehow stumbling past the anxious faces, 
Avoiding the banal, questioning mouths, 
To where the air was cool 
And where I could recover 
From this miracle. . . .
For I had seen the naked mystery of birth
	unfold itself; 
Tortuous, heavy and slow. 
And I had watched, alert and curious 
To learn the meaning. . . .
And here I was more dazed and baffled than before.

Compelling my mind, stabbing my soul to courage, 
Sometimes in the hollow dark,
Sometimes in the crowded day, 
Comes the memory of your room. 
And once again I feel
The terror and the triumph of that loneliness
That wraps us round,Each in his greatest hour,
With exultation and with fertile pain.
