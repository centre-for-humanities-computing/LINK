ONWARD CHRISTIAN NATIONS

Onward Christian Nations,
	Making evermore 
Costly preparations
	For murdering by War. 
Battleships, Torpedoes,
	Armour, Guns and Shells; 
Anything for slaying foes
	The Promoter sells.

Newspapers for lying
	When the truth costs dear;
Fools to do the dying,
	Patriots to cheer. 
Rulers, Priests and Preachers,
	Hypocrites galore, 
Praying to The Prince of Peace
	For Victory in War.
