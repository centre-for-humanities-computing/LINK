TO LOVE ON FEELING ITS APPROACH

Love is a burden, a chain
	,Love is a trammel and tie; 
Love is disquiet and pain
	That slowly go by.

O why should I bind my heart
	And bind my sight? 
Love is only a part
	Of all delight.

Let me have room for the rest, - 
	To find and explore! 
Love is greatest and best?
	But love closes the door

And closes us off so long from the ways
	And concernments of men; 
And owns us, and hinders our days
	O love, come not again!

I have walked with you all my mile,
	Now let me be free, be free! 
O now a little while
	Love, come not back to me!
