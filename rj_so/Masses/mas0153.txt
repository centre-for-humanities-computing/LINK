TOLERANCE AND TRUTH

Sometime, when I hear people mouth the word
	"toleration," 
I am moved by a fury, and a kind of pity too. 
Because I know they have run too long with Compro-
	mise,
That girl of easy virtue, 
Who yields to all with a slack smile, 
And weakens her paramours by their quick and musty 
	victories.

How different they who seek Truth,
She whose radiant virtue is a beacon in strange places.
No man can wholly possess her;
But they become strong who follow her searching foot-
	steps;
Strengthened by that slow and rigorous pursuit -  
And the hope of her shining surrender.
