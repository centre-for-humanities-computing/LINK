HAGGERTY

They say that he was brave and game,
	That's how the navy billed him, 
They say it was a rush of flame, 
	A lump of lead that killed him.

I say it was a rush of oil,
	That overflowed Tampico's wells,
Or else a lump of golden soil,
	Mined from the peons' dripping hells.

And if I owned a mine or well, 
	And had a God to whom I prayed,
I'd know who killed him when he fell, 
	I'd know whose game the bullet played.

He did his duty as he saw,
	And wasted not a thought for me - 
But if there is a higher law, 
	Thank God, he hasn't fought for me!
