THE LITTLE CREATURES

What are they,
All those little white creatures running to and fro?
Are they white mice?
But, no, they are too small for mice,
And they cannot be lice, for they are larger and far
	more active. 
Is there such a thing as a white cockroach? 
Because, if there is, that is surely what they are. 
No, you say, they are not exactly roaches,
 Examine them and you will be able to tell by their
	habits 
What they are 
They run to and fro,
They scurry off behind things and under things, 
They run behind table legs and chair rollers,
And seek refuge under a bookcase, 
They slide into a crack
And lie there flat, hoping they may not be noticed, 
In a flurry they make for a bureau or bed or wash-
	stand
And secrete themselves beneath,
They burrow under the edge of a rug,
Clinging fast with all their legs to the textile above
	them, 
Suffocating,
Their noses embedded in it.
If you rout them out they flee, flee, flee,
Run and tear here and there, 
Anywhere,
Over things and under things
And through the narrowest spaces that almost catch
	and hold them, 
For, being disturbed, they are bewildered, frantic,
 Frenzied for shelter they seek whatever seems to them
	safest,
But they never get off the floor. 
What are they,
These myriads of miserable little white creatures run-
	ning to and fro? 
They are the little white souls of those who are afraid. 
They scuttle away from a great blaze of light, 
They flee from your gaze,
Mad with fear of what they do not comprehend 
They scamper from scrutiny,
They run in misery from the new, the untried, the 
	potent.
They are not exactly roaches, no,
They are the unpleasant little white souls
Of those who are afraid.
