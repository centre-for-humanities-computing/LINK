WYRD

The sunset glows upon my back. 
I know it does, but watch it, 
dream of it, I may not. 
But I may face the man at the helm 
And talk to him while he sends the ca-
	noe like a shaft of light through the 
	waters.

I married him some years ago.How many?I have forgotten.Perhaps I should not have married him. 
I often think so.The maids are putting to bed my chil-
	dren who are said to be very beau-
	tiful.The man at the helm of the boat adores 
	me.Sometimes, even though I have lived	with him - I have forgotten how	many years - 

He is a stranger to me; 
And the sunset and the canoe shooting	through the little white caps 
And the wild birds screaming over my	head 
Are my kinfolk.I said yes to him in a moment when
	the pathways of the stars had 
	crossed.
