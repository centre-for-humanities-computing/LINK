BALLADE FOR THE FOURTH YEAR OF WAR

I, the France of the Marseillaise,
	I would have none of the German thrall.
Flaming, I fought at the Marne's red ways, 
	Made of my breast a brazen wall, 
	Bulwarked the Meuse lest Verdun fall,
Proudly massing a million blades. 
	Now I cry to you, rebels all:
"Tear up stones for the barricades!"

I, the France, of the brave, bright torch, 
	I have been raped and have drunk of gall. 
Ruthless, the alien cannons scorch
	Forest and orchard, hovel, hall.
	Soldiers of kings and tyrants crawl, 
Serving their masters, down my glades.
	Freemen, answer with bomb and ball. 
Tear up stones for the barricades!

I, the France of the rebel hope,
	I am defeated, after all. 
Grimly, the shattered legions grope,
	Striving to pierce the battle's pall.
	You who would free a world in thrall, 
Rally about your palisades!
	Rally before I falter, fall! 
Tear up stones for the barricades!

		ENVOI
Comrades, rise at the bugle call,
	Workers and dreamers, men and maids! 
Crimson flags to the wind for Gaul! 
Tear up stones for the barricades!
