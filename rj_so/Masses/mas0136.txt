THE CHAMPION

	["That is Jack Johnson. I saw him walking down the Strand with his wife on his arm the other night. An English literary man with me gripped his cane and said - 'There goes that dirty nigger. I'd like to bash his head in.' 'Why don't you try it, old top!' retorted I."]

Bronze, and deep-chested as a horse, 
He strikes like lightning in its course.

Naive, ingenuous as a child 
To a new parent reconciled - 

He smiles, he banters, feints and smites, 
And moves, a poem, while he fights. . . .

And his would be the whole world's crown 
Whose fist could bring this Battler down.
