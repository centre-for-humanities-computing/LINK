THE NEWCOMER

Nursed and cradledTo the pagan canticles of field and forest, 
She came to the city 
To work as a librarian. 
A winsome vision of girlhood: 
Flaxen-haired and eager-eyed, 
With cheeks like the skies at early dawn. 
She flutters pastThe corridors of smooth stone and sombre shadowAnd perches herself upon the high stool behind the counter.

Evening comesAnd she glides through the aisles of marble, 
Made ghastly by the yellow gleam of electric lights, 
On her way home.And the ineffaceable brand of the City 
Is stampedOn the leaden feet and weary spirit.
