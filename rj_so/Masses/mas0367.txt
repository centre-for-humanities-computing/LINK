DRYAD

The brown sand path is cool,It flutters across the pale feet of 
	the trees 
Between ocean and bay.It winds among the little green leaves 
Into the sunset.Your feet flash down the cool, brown 
	path.You are running from the cold sea 
Into the warm sunset where the bay 
	glistens.Hist! The oak tree!It is poised in your path with wide 
	arms 
Against the sunset.You cannot pass it,Green eyes,Green coat.You belong in these tree depths.Melt into the warm trunk, Dryad! 
When the white moon burns the dark 
	leavesAnd spatters fire on the ground,I shall come back to caress your breast 
And kiss your pale hands in the moon-
	light.
