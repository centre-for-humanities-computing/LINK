THE TEACHER SPEAKS

The have passed and gone up the windy hill	And the room is dim and still . . . 
And four o'clock this afternoon 
Drifts in the pale white moon.	Over the floor of dust and stains  
	It makes soft, pearly lanes. 
And I sit in my chair and think, and think - 
Watching the great room shrink.	The ghostly desks are facing me -	Each one is facing me. 
And I feel in the winter dusk the heart 
Of the old room touch my heart ...	Outside the pane, a tree sways black	Like a dwarf with a heavy pack, 
A pack of stars from the twilight hill -  
And the room is very still - 	The day has emptied my jeweled pack.	It must brim ere they come back, 
Starry lads and girls who speak, 
Dreaming, so near my cheek.	Ah! I must steal from the sky each gem	And fashion it bright for them; 
Else how shall I meet their morning eyes, 
Their eyes that are young and wise?
