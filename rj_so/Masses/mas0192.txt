ESOERIS

And this was once Esoeris,  
	This swathed and chrysolided thing:	Broken and bound the straining wing - 
Broken and brown and bound she is.

Lie dreaming in your little boat,	Your painted ship with carven prow; 
	Silent your mouth, tranquil your brow,And stilled the pulsing of your throat.

Between black carven bands of hair 
	How ivory warm the painted flesh; 
	How dark the inlaid eyebrows' mesh - How the carved eyelids veil the stare

Of eyes once quick to light with bliss; 
	And the long painted robe of wood 
	Clothes all that once was smooth and good - Clothes all that was Esoeris.
