THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN

Prim of figure and bespectacled, 
Purse-lipped and solemn-eyed, 
She meets all storms of inquiry 
With sharp and terse retort.

Through this swollen maze of printed word
She strides with sure step -  
Only the narrow shoulders, 
Drooping with doubt,Speak piteously of one uncertain of the road.
