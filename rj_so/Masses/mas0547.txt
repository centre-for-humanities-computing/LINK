LEE CRYSTAL

Bronze young leopard
Of radium lighted 
Blackest opal eyes, 
Animalism in its completion, 
Delicate fibre and bone 
Knit to be wounded 
By all emotions. 
Do they think cruelly 
That you'll be tamed at all? 
And (if at all) 
By these police obscenities? 
You who were born to strike 
If struck at.

Bronze young leopard
Of radium lighted
Blackest opal eyes;
Of night hair dipped in
Nature's richest, livest pitch vat;
Patriot,
(If love of liberty is that) 
A few like you 
Would make a nation 
If allowed to know.
