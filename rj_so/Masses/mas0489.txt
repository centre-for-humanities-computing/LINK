COMFORTABLE

My husband has a happy brain -  
It rests in warmth before the fire, 
(Companioned by a pipe and chair). 
He never teases it with problems that
	are hard to solve; 
He never prods or even tickles it; 
But lets it rest in quiet and in peace 
Before the fire - 
(Enveloped in the smoky wreaths); 
His happy, happy, HAPPY brain!
