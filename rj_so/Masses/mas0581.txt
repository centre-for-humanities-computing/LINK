PATRIOTIC SONG NO. 689

	There was a youth  
	Of hair uncouth 
	And Greenwich Village fame 
	He spelled his "through"  
	T-h-r-u  
	And Sinjin was his name.  
	He chanced to see 
	One Saturday 
	As he went out to sup 
	The U. S. N.  
	Desired men  
	Of nineteen years and up.                     

		Cho 
They all have gotta go. to serve their 
	country, 
She's calling for the fearless and the 
	brave, 
he ain't a gonna stand no Huns' ef-
	frontery,                
She'll show 'em who's the ruler of the  
	wave!  

	"This is a chanst
	 For khaki pants,"   
	He said, "which can't be mist.  
	I've had enuff
	 Of Hunnish stuff - 
	I'm no damn Pacifist." 
	Thereafter he 
	To lunch and tea 
	Shook his Byronic head.   
	When he was ast 
	To a repast   
	He sent regrets and said:      

		Cho. 
"I guess I gotta go to serve my country," 
Et cetera, et cetera." 

	The highbrow zone 
	Where Sinjin shone 
	Now knows him as before,  
	Though he prefer  
	To sit a deux 
	And talk about the war.  
	He waves away With air distrait 
	The artists' idle buzz;  
	He might have, seen 
	A submarine  
	And heard a mittrailleuse!      

		Cho.
 For Sinjin might have gone to serve 
	his country, 
Only his head and heart and lungs were 
	queer, 
Those army surgeons show such crass 
	effrontery!               
But one is much more comfortable here.
