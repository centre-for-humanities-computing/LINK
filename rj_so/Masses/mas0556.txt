THE FOOLISH VIRGIN LIGHTS HER LAMP

In the first dreaming days, 
	The day of dreams, 
A friendly generous phrase 
More than its words conveys 
Subtle and welcome praise; 
	Smilingly gleams - 

In the first dreaming days, 
	The day of dreams.

Tender the darkness deep,
	Dear the deep dark. 
Psyche, o'er Love, asleep, 
At his closed eyes to peep, 
(Curiously, fondly peep,) 
	Kindles a spark.

Dearer the darkness deep -  
	Best the deep dark.

The eyes are alien eyes - 
	His eyes estranged! 
Psyche, unwarned, unwise, 
In candle glow, surprised,
An old fear verifies - 
	Mocking and changed,

Malicious, stranger eyes - 
	His eyes, estranged!
