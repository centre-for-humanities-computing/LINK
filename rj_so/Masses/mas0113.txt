ZENOBIA

Lo, Caesar's legioned army, victor-led,A sight to glad and pride the Roman eye! Wrinkled and monster elephants sweep by, Making the earth to quake beneath their tread;Caesar, himself, with laurel on his head, Rides next, and all his banners flaunt the sky.But now the eager concourse gapes and hums,For She who makes the triumph-march complete,Zenobia, naked and imperial, comes,With gold chains chiming from her hands and feet - Her kingdom overthrown, herself a prize -Yet no capitulation in her eyes!
