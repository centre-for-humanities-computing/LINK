TOY GUNS

The rain is slipping, dripping down the street.
The day is gray as ashes on the hearth. 
The children play with soldiers made of tin.
		While you sew,
		Row after row.

The tears are slipping, dripping one by one.
Your son has shot and wounded his small brother.T
he mimic battle's ended with a sob.
		While you dream
		Over your seam.

The blood is slipping, dripping drop by drop. 
The men are dying in the trench's mud. 
The bullets search the quick among the dead.
		While you drift, 
		The Gods sift.

The ink is slipping, dripping from the pens,
On papers "White" and "Orange," "Red" and Gray."
History for the children of tomorrow.
		While you prate
		About Fate.

War is slipping, dripping death on earth, 
If the child is father of the man. . .  
Is the toy gun father of the Krupps?
		For Christ's sake think!
			While you sew, 
			Row after row.
