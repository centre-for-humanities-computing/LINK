AEOLIAN

Who the strange sounding melody
	Of ancient harps have known; whose feet 
	In old days trod the sands of Crete - 
What is the tale of days to me?

The ways of men are strange to me; 
	And strange the voices of my kin, 
	Like thin ghosts in a world as thin.
(I tread the fields of memory.)

In the far fields of memory
	I see the star-faced asphodel,
	And hear the voice of philomel! 
(What is the tale of days to me?)

Past the green hills, the blue I see
	Reaching the shore of lands unknown. 
	On grasses where the winds have blown
I tread the fields of memory.
