KEEPING COOL

Under the shadowing trees they lie;
The Sun's hot eye
Peeps through the chinks of the latticed leaves 
As he goes by.

Mother is cool and ruffly and white
In heat's despite.
Baby's in his cherub suit, his wings 
Tucked out of sight - 
Young Adam, naked and unwise,
So soon to lose his paradise!
