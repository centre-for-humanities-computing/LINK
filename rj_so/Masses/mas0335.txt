A QUESTION

Ho! you schoolmen, you gang of philosophers 
	whose souls are tuned to the crackling of 
	parchment.You scholars with your pale brows immersed 
	in antique customs, interpreting ancient rites.You capon priests, who, when you want to appear im-
	pressive condemning women dress yourselves in 
	women's clothes (true feminists I think);You gray haired jurists (some of you bald) who also 
	try to look majestic in women's clothes while you 
	get rich selling justice;

You too, you beardy, lusty fellows (although at that 
	some of you are consumptive), you who howl the 
	long prayers of Democracy to the shuffling, sweaty 
	brothers around the holy soap box, at night on a 
	street corner;Poets too and fellows who try to copy the sunlight on	stretched cloth; 
Gentlemen all, in a way of speaking;

Attention now! I put you a question.Why is it that I can walk all day through the fields and 
	woods breathing the fine air and maybe plucking a 
	wild rose to pieces and never think evil or of a 
	cruel or an ugly thing,

And yet when I reach the edge of the city again when	the evening is coming down, 
When I stop to contemplate a rotten fence with filth	oozing through into a stinking alley where a ragged	child is making mud pies and eating fever, 

I can think of nothing but your laws and systems, your	philosophies and religion?
