WIND CRY

You have brought me the torn
	sweetness of blossoms 
And the acrid taunt of withered leaves, 
The roar of stamping cataracts 
And the faint call 
Of dim voices from the hills.

You have quickened my blood 
And I have wrestled with you 
In growing strength

. . . But now I am weary -  
Can you not bring me peace!
