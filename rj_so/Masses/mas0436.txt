A GREEK COFFEE HOUSE

It is late May 
And yet they sit about the stifling 
	room,
Playing at cards or pool 
And drinking coffee endlessly. 
One flickering yellow arc-light 
Casts weird shadows on their faces, 
Half obscured by soft slouch hats,
On shirt sleeves, and on dark sus-
	penders 
That alone appear to bind 
Body and soul together. 
A cold base-burner takes the place 
Of moon and stars 
To these strange forms 
Who herd within four dingy walls. 
The door and two blurred windows 
Are tight shut, 
And every puff of smoke 
Poises,
Or drifts inertly on the lifeless air.

Yet these are men who might know 
	love
Or passionate hate.
With some blind instinct they have
	closed all doors 
Against the scent of lilacs, 
And against the dense black loneliness 
And stifling heart-ache 
Of the wide cool summer night.
