PETER PAN OBIT

Good-bye, Peter. So long. A sweet rest to youand 
	tuneful dreams. 
You have beguiled many a hearty vagabond with your
	laughing pipes. 
You have lured many a Fifth Avenue belle to holy
	matrimony.
Many a tired housemaid dreamed herself somewhere 
	near a purple pool listening to lyric reeds, be-
	cause of you,
When all she heard, poor wench, was the water running
	into a soapy dishpan. 
And I know a horde of magazine poetesses who have
	used you for a meal ticket. 
(But all that's neither here nor there. I am as guilty
	myself.)
Good-bye, Peter. So long. A sweet rest to you and
	tuneful dreams. 
It's all over now. No more the merry fluting of your
	luring pipes;
No more your playful skipping in the forest green.
	Good-bye. A long farewell. 
Your pathology was all wrong from the start. 
The modern playwright has found you out. Forgive
	me, Peter Pan.  
But not a drama critic now but knows in his heart why
	you didn't grow up. 
After all it was lucky you were not born to a Eugenic
	couple in Wisconsin, 
Or over there in Jersey where they make backward
	children build Montessori houses all day long
	with little wood blocks (that would be hard on
	you).
Even the pink-cheeked young lady at the social settle-
	ment house knows you were a product of shame.
(O my God, Peter; why didn't you grow as big as 
	Jack Johnson?)
Good-bye, Peter. So long. A sweet rest to you and 
	tuneful dreams.
But listen before I say the last adieux over your poor 
	little body.
If you value your reputation, or that of your foolish
	parents, please don't come back. 
If you do, Old Bernard Shaw will write a play to prove
	that your mother had specific lame back. 
And believe me, that sardonic fellow could prove it 
	before the end of the first act, if he didn't have
	to write three acts to hold the audience. 
So good-bye, Peter. Farewell and tuneful dreams. 
(Our minds are all aseptic now and we never can
	enjoy your like again.)
