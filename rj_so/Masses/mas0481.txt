THE WIND OF DEATH

The wind of Death blew down the world   
	And every shutter made 
A little chink to let it in 
	As broad as a sword blade.

The wind of Death blew down the world,
	But those who shuddered saw 
The ravelled rose-leaves driven like rain
	Before the bugling flaw.

The wind of Death blew down the world -  
	And down all roads they went;
Youth in a gust of red rose-leaves, 
	Drunk with the roses' scent.

The wind of Death blew down the world;
	But sure, the dear God knows 
There lurks the smell of the long-dead
	Where such a black wind blows!

The wind of Death blew down the world,
	And God must hear the cry 
In every bitter root that gave
	Red roses to the sky!
