THE OLD MAID AND THE VIOLET VENDOR

There he goes,
An old man, far from youth's Springtime, 
Carrying violets,
The flowers of youth and Spring.
His coat is grey-green and shiny and threadbare - 
His trousers are old and loose and baggy,
And the cuffs of them, flapping around his cracked
	shoes,
 Are badly frayed.
His fingers are blue and numb and clumsy 
In the cold Spring rain, 
And he walks slowly, 
But his eyes are hopeful, 
For he is carrying violets,
And he believes that he will make money to-day. 

He studies the faces
Of all who pass by on the streets of the city -  
He knows all classes and kinds, 
For he has seen them often.
He offers violets humbly to fat, well-dressed dowagers,
Gently to younger women,
Suggestively to idle young men,
Persuasively to kind old fathers.
To all he offers violets as if he loved them,
As if he were conferring a favor,
And he does love them. . . .

I love them, too,
The long-stemmed, mystic beauties,
But he does not offer them to me.
There is no hope in his eyes when I pass.
Perhaps he has guessed that I work in an office around
	the corner, 
Perhaps he knows that I am poor, 
That I cannot afford to buy violets. 
But he does not know that I love them, 
That I walk down this street to see them every day; 
He does not know that I envy him 
The scent of violets on his numb cold fingers 
More than I envy him his hope 
That he will make money to-day. 
He does not know that I envy him 
The possession of so much beauty 
Though I am less shabby than he 
And nearer to youth's Springtime.

Some clay, when the Spring sun is shining,
After this cold rain,
I might surprise him;
I might go without my dinner, once,
And buy violets,
Yes, long-stemmed mystic beauties, 
The flowers of youth and Spring.
