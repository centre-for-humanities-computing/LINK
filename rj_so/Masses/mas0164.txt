SINGALESE LOVE SONGS

		IYour eyes are beautiful beggars,Careless, singing minstrels, 
Who will not starve
Nor sleep cold under the sky 
If they receive no largess 
Of mine.

Once lived a woman 
Of great charity - 

At last Her own childrenBegged for bread.

		III would make you love me  
That you might possess 
Desire.

For to your heartBeauty is a burned-out torchAnd Faith, a blind pigeon,Friendship, a curious Persian mythAnd Love, blank emptinessBearing no significanceNor any reality - 

Only Weariness is yours; 
I would make you love me 
That you might possess 
Desire.

		IIIIs my love 
Of flesh or spirit? 
I only know, to me 
Your eyes are wholly you.

Our glances DartLike the flash of a birdGone before the color of its wingIs seen.

I have not bathed my soulIn your eyes,My soul would drown.

		IVI have starved to know your lips,Yet my soul 
Does not die of want.

For everything real is desire, 
And fulfillment is an illusion. 
There is but one fulfillment 
Blind Nature's way - 

My arms reach toward illusion 
And I would carry mist against my 
	heart,Starving, I hold my dream 
Not the warm, heavy head 
Of a sleeping child.

		VWhat do you seek 
Beloved?

When you have hadAll of meThere will remainOne beautiful desire the lessFor you.

You think you seek my love But vou seek 
My denial.Hunger, want, 
Is the only painI would not spare you -Alas, that too 
Will die.
