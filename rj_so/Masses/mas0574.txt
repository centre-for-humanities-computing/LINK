YOU

First you were a great storm, 
Swooping upon me with white
	 wings; 
Battered and breathless under the wind 
	I lay. 
There was beauty and terror in the 
	night,                 
Darkness, and the light of snow;
 And the wind of you was a roaring in 
	my ears. 

Now you are the broad sky,                
Still and clear beyond the clouds; 
You are over me always, height of the 
	air I breathe.                
The earth changes under my feet, 
The wind fades, but the sky remains.
When I die, the last that I see will be 
	the sky.
