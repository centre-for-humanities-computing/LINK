CUSTOM

We have some customs that are rather odd;
The strangest are our compliments to God.

We tell him of his greatness; we explain
How much we love him - and then ask for rain.

We say, "Omnipotent, oh thou Unknown 
We bow to Thee," then strike him for a loan.

We strive and toil and win, with work and grit 
And then most humbly thank our God for it
