A JAPANESE PRINT

It is a picture of rain in Japan. 
	The rain and the winds have made 
	friends.
Oh the havoc that is wrought in Japan 
When the rain and the winds have
	made friends! 
I am thinking of Japanese lanterns - 
Those flimsy paper lanterns 
Of a hundred different colors. 
The Japanese lady -  
The green-and blue- and yellow-clad
	lady - 
Forgets her Japanese decorum 
When her face is to the storm. 
The rain flows through her Japanese
	umbrella;
The wind rends holes in her paper um-
	brella.
Japanese umbrellas and Japanese lan-
	terns
Are fit only for summer gardens, or in
	colored pictures. 
They should be hid when the wind and
	the rain have made friends 
In Japan!
