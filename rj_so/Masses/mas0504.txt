EARTH AND STARS

I have looked at the stars too long, 
	I think,
For my soul hangs lonely above the
	brink 
Of a wild, bright chasm, a strange, far 
	sea,
Where only my dreams float out to me. 
There is light and splendor and lifting
	wings, 
But the aching wonder of untouched
	things. 

Night wind, blow me a breath of soil,
 Fresh-turned by the plowman's eager 
	toil;
Of blossomy hedges with birds asleep,
 Of mint-grown gardens where house
	cats creep, 
Of a rose-wreathed porch and a lover's
	song.
I have looked at the stars too long.
