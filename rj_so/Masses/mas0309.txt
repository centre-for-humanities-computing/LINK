GYPSY SONG

Gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, 
	Can't you hear the call? 
South, the sap is sighing
	Through the timber tall! 
Romany is crying
	"Come and leave it all!"

Romany of olden,
	Glad and gypsy gleams! 
Daffodils are golden
	By the silver streams! 
Can you be beholden,
	Save, alone, to dreams?

Would you wait to weather 
	Dust and dark and drouth?
Only love can tether - 
	Kisses on the mouth!
You and I together - ! 
	Springtime on the South - !

Gypsy, gypsy, gypsy,
	Springtime walks with me
Where the sap is turning 
	Sunward! Are you free?
For we seek the burning 
	Camps of Romany!
