INDEPENDENCE HALL

There is an old, old city 
	Beside the Delaware, 
Whose life flows round the cloister 
	Called Independence Square;

Beneath the cool green arches
	Reared by its quiet trees, 
Through all the long hot summer
	There runs a little breeze.

A breath of air that rises
	And dies away again, 
As fleeting as the longings
	Of tired workingmen

,Who sit there on the benches
	Too tired to move or laugh, 
With eyes fixed on Old Glory,
	Drooping from the tall staff;

And there they talk together
	About the shady Square 
And wonder why that building
	Should still be standing there.
