AN ODE TO HIMSELF BY HIMSELF

O you sad and comic goulash, 
Yet sprightly blue of eye -  
Reflex of the soft-feathered dawn, 
Of Yearnings and Ideals.
 Blunt wanderer among ideas, - 
With all people -  
Particularly the failures and 
Rough of neck. 
You poor pathetic misnomer, 
Don't you know that Propaganda 
Can't be Art?
You chaser of chiaroscuro, - 
Chase yourself!
