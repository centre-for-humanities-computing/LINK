INDECISION

I've half a mind to ask you down the	lane,A star-whirled way where kisses may be	had 
In dream-touched turnings shadowed by 
	a vine,	And safe from neighbors with their	windows up - Yes, I've half a mind to ask you down 
	the lane,And yet the other half. . . Is full of her who walked there yester-	year.
