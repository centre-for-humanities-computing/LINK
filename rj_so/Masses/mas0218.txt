COST

Daughter of mine 
I feel the wrinkles growing 
and the flatness growing 
and the greyness growing 
and the coldness growing 
	upon me

And I see you 
filling with grace 
flushing pinker 
moving with the fleetness 
of a two year old filly.

Are they taken from me 
to be given to you?

Could I have held 
the grace
and the moving flush 
and the fleet strength 
a little longer 
alone?

Phloxes are blooming in the garden 
And marigolds. 
My Grandmother cuts them 
And puts them in vases.
	I gathered fleur de lys when they 
		were blooming
	And the roses.
	Now I am waiting
	For chrysanthemums.
