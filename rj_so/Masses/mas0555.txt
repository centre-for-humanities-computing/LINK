PINS

She bathed laughing and dried her 
lithe body to a stinging rosi-
ness. She touched her neck and her 
arms with faint perfume that had a
bout it the shadowy elusive odor of 
the little snow-violets that grow in 
dark moist places in the woods. She 
smiled into her own eyes in the 
broad mirror of her bureau, as she 
put on the fresh white garments she 
had laid out, as she made fast around 
her head the two soft braids of her 
hair.
	She swayed, lightly . .
	She thought of the quickening of 
this exquisite throbbing in her veins 
to ecstasy. . . to peace.
	A clock began to strike slowly in 
the tower of a church down the 
street.
	It was the hour.
	She held; out her arms to herself 
in the mirror.
	As she bent to pick up a pin from 
the bureau-cover, she saw that there 
were two pins there, and that they 
lay upon each other in the form of a 
cross.
	"Jesu," she whispered, and made 
the sign . . . She stood looking at 
the pins that were a cross.
	The clock stopped striking. 
	She heard a step at the door.
