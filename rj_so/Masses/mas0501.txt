SPRING

Spring comes
The sky is blue. 
Little white clouds kiss the tops of the 
	hills.
Birds sing before their mating.
The apple orchards are pink with
	promise. 
Lovers tremble with yearning.

The fields are sponges of blood. 
The too-green woods cover corpses -  
	rotting.
Carrion birds glut themselves. 
Monsters - pieces of men - go about. 
Women, with dead souls, live on. 
Children know horrors. 
Under the fire of the guns and the roar
	and the shriek of the shells, 
Hate and Death each make glad the 
	other.

Yet, all serene, unmoved, in beauty, 
The Spring has come! 
And, after Spring, Summer, silent, hot, 
	growing,
And after Summer, Autumn, all purple
	and silver, and scarlet and gold, 
Celebrating fruition.
And after Autumn, Winter, her sheet 
	covering beautifully Earth's dead 
	brings 
Till they decay. 
And, then - another Spring!
