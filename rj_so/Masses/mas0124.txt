THE DEAD

Sometimes you used to take my hand in yoursAnd sigh - your eyes grew somber as you said, 
"I think the hope of things is dead - The joy of life died long ago - "Your face was like a child's who dreads to hear 
The crash of storm, and cringes in his fear. 
One time I was not there to soothe and say, 
"Dear heart, the bronze-brown butterflies still drift 
Above the thistles, and the daisies lift T
heir golden heads along the dusty road - "

And so you crept away, content that I 
Should live the agony it costs to die.
