A PSALM NOT OF DAVID

The LORD is our Shepherd, and we are the sheep	of His pasture; 
He gives us His tender care, and our needful food and 
	drink,And at the appointed time delivers us, all of us, to the 
	shearer,Or to the butcher, to be slaughtered - for that is what 
	sheep are for.

Never the shepherd watches the sheep for their good, 
Never he lets them live out their lives in joy and in 
	triumph;Always the shepherd uses the sheep for his pleasure,
Caring naught for their welfare save as it hurts him	or helps him. 
The Lord is our Shepherd.

If we are sheep, we will praise our Shepherd, 
We will meekly bow to His will, accept His food and 
	His drink,And at the appointed time trot sheepishly to the shear-
	ing or butchering.If we are men, we will snatch His crook from the 
	Shepherd's hands,And break it over His fleeing shoulders, and go on 
	our way rejoicing.
