A VOICE

When we are ground into reluctant dust,
Unsmiling and unconquered, stubborn still; 
When the last drop falls, when the dry touch of rust 
Benumbs each will:
We will step from the boards still valorous, still 
	proud
(Hope for a halo, courage for a shroud): 
We will go - but we will go unreconciled 
And undefiled.
