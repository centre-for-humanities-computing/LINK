LITTLE DAUGHTER OF THE STREETS

Oh little daughter of the streets,                  
	Wild with an errant will, 
Where vagrant and drunk and beggar 
	meet, 
The currents of the common street 
Lie open for your straying feet,                  
	Young feet that are not still.                 

Wayward and idle, free and wild, 
	Your own will is your way.                 
Our hedges and our dykes are lies,                
Too low to hold you, grown too wise,  
(You of the bold and wilful eyes) 
	Too petulant to stay.

 Dull tasks and high brick walls we set 
	Between the sun and you. 
When you break forth in laughing guise, 
(Oh hard young mouth and bright young 
	eyes)                      
Your brimming pleasure-zest defies 
	Thin rules you trample through.                 

Hunger for life and thirst for joy, 
Bold for thrust and hot for praise,                 
You enter all the gleaming ways,                
(You of the flushed, undaunted gaze) 
	So sure and unafraid. 

Little daughter of the streets, 
	Wild with an. errant will, 
How long can your tremulous beauty 
	hold,                
The arrogant grace, the touch of bold 
And wanton joy, the glint of gold,                  
	Young heart that is not still?
