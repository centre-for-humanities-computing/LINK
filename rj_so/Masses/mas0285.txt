MURMURINGS IN A FIELD HOSPITAL

Come to me only with playthings now . . . 
	A picture of a singing woman with blue eyes 
Standing at a fence of hollyhocks, poppies and sun-
	flowers . . .
Or an old man I remember sitting with children telling
	stories
Of days that never happened anywhere in the 
	world . . .

No more iron cold and real to handle,
Shaped for a drive straight ahead.
Bring me only beautiful useless things.
Only old home things touched at sunset in the
	quiet . . . 
And at the window one day in summer 
Yellow of the new crock of butter 
Stood against the red of new climbing roses . . .
And the world was all playthings.
