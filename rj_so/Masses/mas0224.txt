POOR GIRL

There was an earthquake in my heart, and I
	Have been what I have been.
Now - there's the long street and this bitter sky
	Crying "Unclean! Unclean!"

But you're, more swine -  you -  you who have with-
	stood, -
	So smug, so self-sufficed! 
Oh, there's a thing called "frenzy" in my blood
	Snarls at your frock-coat Christ!

"Seduction," "the starvation wage"? Not me!
	I seemed to flower in flame. 
And so - my "soul is lost eternally,"
	You say. You "view my shame."

Oh, can that guff! If I'm no startled hare,
	I'm caught. I know your traps. 
I took my chance. You've got me in the snare,
	Society - perhaps!

Call me "poor girl," and psalm-sing through your nose!
	The harlot - she gets hers. '
Think I should fawn on God then, I suppose?
	You whited sepulchres!

Some poet will, even put me in a song
	And sell it - just to live. 
People buy books: to read why I "go wrong."
	I gave - and I forgive.
