THE FATHER

Give me a drink, Joe. The kid's dead and I'm all of a tremble: 
Look at my hand.
How could I stay in the flat - him laying there with
	his little white face, and the old woman crying
	and blaming it all on me. 
He was six years old and big enough and I sent him
	out for a pint one night. The old woman kicked
	but I had my way. 
He came back snivelling, said he had slipped, and I
	lammed him good for spilling the beer. 
He's been sick ever since - the damned doctors said
	it was his spine. 
With the old woman fussing over him and giving
	me hell till I hated to come in the house. 
And he died tonight.....Let's have another
	one, Joe
I can't go home - him laying there with his little 
	white face and the old woman crying and blam-
	ing it all on me.
