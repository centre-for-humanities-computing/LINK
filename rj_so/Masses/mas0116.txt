THAT GOD MADE

This is the Earth that God made.These are the Timber and Coal and OilAnd Water Powers and fertile Soil That belong to us all in spite of the gall Of the Grabbers and Grafters who forestall The natural rights and needs of all Who live on the Earth that God made.These are the Corporate Snakes that coil Around the Timber and Coal and OilAnd Water Powers and fertile Soil Which belong to us all in spite of the gall Of the Grabbers and Grafters who forestallThe natural rights and needs of all Who live on the Earth that God made.These are the Lords of Mill and Mine Who act as if they were divine, Who can't read the writing on the wallBut admire the skill and excuse the gall Of the Grabbers and Grafters who forestall The natural rights and needs of allWho live on the Earth that God made.These are the Parsons shaven and shornWho tell the workers all forlorn To pray for contentment night and morn And to bear and to suffer want and scorn And be lowly and meek and humbly seek For their just reward on the Heavenly shore,But not on the Earth that God made.
