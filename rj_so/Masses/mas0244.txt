JOHN COOK

John Cook, the clerk,S
hut down his desk.T

he plain, yellow walled office
Held him a moment inanimate
As if he were part of its furniture - 
Covered typewriters, chairs and filing cases,
Waste paper baskets on the bare board floor - 
One with its stillness and miscellany.

Then he walked out into the hall and stood before a 
	window there.

The city stretched in roof-tops under him.
Away toward the Battery and the Bay
A gray sharp barrier stood
Crusted with diamond points,
A glittering pile against the west and night.

John Cook looked over there. 
He forgot the people who employed him 
And the bread-wage like the thirty pieces of silver they 
	paid him,
For which he sold the dream which was his Master.
Doubtless to them his soul seemed 
Wooden and varnished,
Just as his body seemed to them, wooden and varnished,
When they came into the office
And did not distinguish him from its fixtures.

Then he thought, to himself, there alone: 
"Beauty whereby we live! 
The Egyptian built his pyramid 
Yet he never saw anything like that, 
Given to me to see,
And I couldn't buy one stone to set on another! 
Would I rather have seen the walls of Babylon o
	gated Troy 
Or look over there 
At Mt. Woolworth and Mt. Singer 
Above the lesser summits of their range, 
Fire-netted in the sky!
What is weariness and worry and silence to that sight
	which I can drink 
Thankfully at one wise pull of vision and splendor. . . .

"Clear water at the end of day 
You hold for me, Brides of Hope,
Lifting your giant lovelinesses to the dusk, 
Draped from crown to hem with ropes of light -  
Mt. Singer and Mt. Woolworth, my sisters,
Fire-netted in the sky!"
