I CRY FOR WAR

I glory in the rush of armed troops,The unfurled flag, - the frowning guns 
In gloomy garb of black.

My spirit sings to whistling shells 
That tear the flesh of children 
Built in the image of my God.

I cheer the charge of bloody feetThat crush to silence the curdling shrieksOf bullet-bitten men.

Fire and pillage and outraged women, 
Pay tribute to my country's dignity, 
Homage to my country's flag.

Who am I that proclaim the Godhead of Mars? 
I am a Christian - a man and a citizen - 
I am an American patriot.
