THE ANIMAL STORE

The female warden of the cages -  
Short-legged, 
Crooked-backed, 
Scraggly-haired and toothless. 
Outcast from her kind, 
She moves about the fetid room with 
	dignity.The marmosets chitter as she goes by;The birds carol joyfully;The cats me-ow;The dogs snuffle and bark;The goldfish leap to the top;She knows their little language - Companion, benefactress, queen,Outcast from her kind!
