WHEN I HAVE TEA

I sit alone and have my tea -  
	My windows open wide; 
The silent gods, they sup with me 
	And the sweet world outside:

The tip-top branches of the trees 
	Wave their green hands in glee;I wonder if they ever guess 
	How lonely I can be?

The pink and purple clouds sail by,	The blue lies in between 
To let the sun look gaily through	And find my silver clean;

A little grey-winged bird or two 
	Cuts through my yellow light - I wonder if they sense how much
	 My day is flecked with night?

And when the tender glow is fled, 
	And out come star and star,I wonder if they whisper soft, 
	"How lonely Women are!"?
