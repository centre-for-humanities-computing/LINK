Irony

Out of soul strife I write madness. 
The tang of life is too bitter or 
too sweet in my mouth. Rage grips me o
ver the ineffectiveness of man and I 
snarl unto women : bear ye no more for
 the maw of life, to whine like hungry 
dogs over meatless bones.
	Then again, I smother in ecstasy. 
Life is a splash of scarlet sprawled over 
a yellow canvas. Fuchsias are poppies. 
Men pull down the stars
	Out of soul strife I write madness. 
And tonight a woman fondling a Pe-
kingese poodle told me I must let her 
read one of my little pieces some time.
