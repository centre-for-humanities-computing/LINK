THE TRYST

The place is glad with many flowers, and gentle	With color of green grass and blue-green		leaves;
	Here tiger lilies stand in splendid sheaves.

Glows air and ocean with returning April.	Light breezes, odorous of the summer sea,	Flutter the pendant plumes of bush and tree.

And then comes she like a sunbeam from the		forest;Clad all in white, with roses at her bare breast.
