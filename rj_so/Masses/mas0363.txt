ELEGY

There is one Spring,	One April of delight;And all the rest is but remembering 
	One moon-lit night.
Weave round its spell 
	An elegy of song,But never think the white hawthome can 
	dwell 
With you for long.

It is so fair 
	And delicate a thing;A sudden wind leaves blossoming twigs all bare 
	Of covering.

White petals fall	Bewildered, at your feet;And Spring makes of the whitest flower 
		of all 
	 A winding sheet
