BATTLE HYMN

Yes, Jim hez gone - ye didn't know? 
	He's fightin' at the front. 
It's him as bears "his country's hopes," 
	An' me as bears the brunt.

Wen war bruk out Jim 'lowed he'd go - 	He allus loved a scrapâ€š - 
Ye see, the home warn't jest the place	Fer sech a lively chap.

O' course, the work seems ruther hard;	The kids is ruther small - 
It ain't that I am sore at Jim,	I envy him - that's all.

It makes him glad and drunken-like	The music an' the smoke; 
An' w'en they shout, the whole thing seems	A picnic an' a joke.

Oh, yellin' puts a heart in ye, 
	An' stren'th into yer blows -I wisht that I could hear them cheers 
	Washin' the neighbors' clo'es.

It's funny how some things work out - 
	Life is so strange, Lord love us - Here I am, workin' night an' day 
	To keep a roof above us;

An' Jim is somewhere in the south,	An' Jim ain't really bad, 
A-runnin' round an' raisin' Cain,	An' stabbin' some kid's dad.

He doesn't know what he's about
	 An' cares still less, does Jim.With all his loose an' roarin' ways 
	I wisht that I was him.
