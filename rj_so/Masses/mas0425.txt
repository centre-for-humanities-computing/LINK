MAKING A SAFE

Make a safe for democracy - shut it inside
	To keep till the war's safely past -  
Till the Powers that Be shall benignly decide
	It is safe to unlock it at last; 
And let the Combination be known 
To the Powers that Be, and to them alone.
	If they should forget it! . . Oh never say die! 
	The people must blow up the safe by and by.
