A GOOD MAN

A mother had builded a fine, fair man 
With her half-of-a-lifetime's best;
	Then wearily, happily turned to plan 
A little vacation and rest.

My country calls me to arms! (he said, 
	And he left his play and his work.)
I may be wounded or ill or dead, 
	But never a coward or shirk. 
			She paid.

In the breast of a little orphan fool, 
	The tides of the springtime raged.
She was not sheltered in love's kind school, 
	She was roped and branded and caged.
I'll trifle with no man's wife, nor hold
	A good girl lightly (said he); 
I'll go where favors are bought and sold,
	No one will be hurt but me. 
			She paid.

His Woman gave him the woman's hail, 
	Ready in spirit and flesh and mind;
Their children waited beyond the veil - 
	But he turned away, he was just and kind.

I must earn a home in the lonely lands,
	For I gave my purse to a friend; and You - 
I will not meet You with empty hands; 
	Wait for me, wait for me, wait, be true. 
			She paid.
