BROADWAY AT NIGHT

		I. 
I went to look for pleasure 
I saw only children 
Whom God was chastening; 
And one old person 
Dimly, 
In a glass.

		II.
You in scarlet, 
I in gray,
Have walked tonight the great White 
	Way.
I, clinging to a lawful arm; 
You, fearless in the midst of harm. 
I, shocked, yet thrilling through and 
	through,
Liking the crowd, the lights - and you.

Were you not there for me to see, 
The street would be quite dull for me. 
I quite believe you'd miss me too 
ere I not there to stare at you.

When safe in bed at my hotel 
I heard a horrid Dream foretell 
That on parade at Judgment Day 
I'd be in scarlet 
You in gray,
And at this change miraculous 
The Saints would stare at both of us.
