A MOTHER

My children are gone all day 
Even at noon 
They have luncheon at school. 
When they were little I stayed with 
	them
Mended their little clothes and toys 
Gave up my friends for them 
Let my mind get rusty and didn't care 
For they needed me. 
But now they are away all day 
And my husband is away too,
What is there for me? 
There are so many things I'd like to
	know.
Why doesn't some one form a school
For women over fifty?
