THE RETIRED ACROBAT

His vast shouldersSurge beyond the confines of the wide, cushioned seat,His outstretched legsEnd in a pair of ungainly, square shoesThat are always unlaced;Bright patches of carmine(A habit from past theatrical days)Gild his cheeks;And the long moustache and unkempt shock of hair 
Are dyed a sheeny black.

Lying open,Hidden within the palms of his gigantic hands 
Is a small, thin volume of De Musset's;
 And with a thick-muscled finger 
He turns the flimsy pages 
Of delicately-scented verse.
