THE INSCRUTABLE GODS

They make the fire to burn, 
	et keep the green wood wet; 
And urging life to understand 
	They let it still forget.

For when we seek to learn,
	They baffle and abet, 
And make youth slow to understand
	But slow, slow, to forget;

And when the long tides turn,
	They urge and hinder yet; 
For age, grown quick to understand,
	Is quick, quick, to forget 

O strange gods, kind and stern,
	That build and then upset, 
What would you? Lest we understand
	Too much, must we forget?

Or, seeing all fuels burn
	To ashes, must we let 
The soul flame on to understand,
	But what it burns forget?
