THE PARADE

Gay flags flying down the street; 
Comes the drum's insistent beat 
Like a fierce, gigantic pulse - 
And the screaming fife exults.Soldier, soldier, spic and span, 
Aren't you the lucky man? 
Splendid, in your gold and blue -  
How the small boy envies you!Oh, there's a glory for you here -  
Girls to smile and men to cheer; 
Bands behind and bands before, 
Thrilling with the lust of War.Soldier, soldier - now you go 
Forth to meet a sanguine foe, 
Bravely do you face the brink, 
Fired with music and with drink.Stalwart warrior pass, and be 
Glad you are not such as we -  
We, who, without flags or drums, 
March to battle in the slums.Doctors, teachers, workers - we 
Are a stubborn soldiery; 
Combating, till we convert, 
Ignorance, disease and dirt.Soldier, soldier, look and then 
Laugh at us poor fighting-men, 
Struggling on, though every street 
Is the scene of our defeat.Laugh at us, who, day by day, 
Come back beaten from the fray -  
We, who find our work undone -  
We, whose wars are never won!Gay Hags flying down the street; 
Come, the drum's insistent beat 
Like a fierce, gigantic pulse -  
And the screaming fife exults!
