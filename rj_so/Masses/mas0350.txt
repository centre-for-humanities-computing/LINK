THE BOY WHO REFUSED TO GO TO CHURCH

ALEXIS ABERCROMBIE BIRCH
When young, refused to go to church; 
Though oft commanded, as a rule 
He'd balk before the vestibule:

He did not fear the cruel rods 
Of bloody, Israelitish Gods, 
Nor did he feel the better for 
A sacrifice of human gore:

Though seas of sinners' blood were spilt 
In hymns of sanguinary lilt, 
He did not care at all forsooth, - 
And this, they said, was due to youth:

Alexis Abercrombie, - list! -  
Became a wicked pacifist, 
As would, 'twas stated, any Birch 
Who never, never went to church.
