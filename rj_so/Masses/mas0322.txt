SPRING

These are the days when hearts
	must feel
A stronger quickening,
For lighted on the foothills burn
	The first green fires of Spring.

But some there are may never heed
	The call of earth and skies,
But from the prison house of life
	Look forth with wistful eyes - 

Far, far beyond the city's pave
	Where beckon friendly trees,
And mountains veil their ancient scars
	With pale anemones
