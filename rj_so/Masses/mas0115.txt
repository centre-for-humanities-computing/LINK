THE PENDULUM

My greatest grandsire was the Scythe,	That swung and swung and in its swingLopped off, shore through, and left to writhe 	Each moribund and evil thing.Men robbed me of my trenchant steel,	Gave me a silly golden face, And fitted me to cog and wheel	To swing forever in my placeI mark the night that creeps toward day,	The day that tires of light and dies, Eternally I tick my way 	From compromise to compromise,Until the times grow sick of waste,	This wasted strength that goes for nought,And set me free and bid me taste 	The blood of evil deed and thought.Oh ! some strong man shall whet my blade 	And, singing, swing me in the sun,Till all the tangles Man has made	Are hacked and blazed, that he may runHis spacious pathway, clean and clear, 	To where the holy city lies. . . .His soul no longer bound to veer 	From compromise to compromise.
