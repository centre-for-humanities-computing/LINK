WELL! WELL!

DEAR SIR:
Just
when I thought
Upton Sinclair
was deador grown rusty
he pops up
again
making believe 
he doesn't like 
"Free Verse."

Well, well,
one can't tell
by the label
a fellow may go about
editing anthologies
of social protest
one minute
and "knocking" "Free Verse"
 the next.

It's the fad 
nowadays 
to "attack" 
"vers libre."

Even
Don Marquis'
cockroach 
is at it
now. 
Amen.
