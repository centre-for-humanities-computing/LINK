GOD AND THE STRONG ONES

"We have made them fools and weak!" said the Strong Ones:	"We have bound them, they are still and deaf and blind,We have crushed them in our hands like a heap of crumbling" sands, 
	We have left them naught to seek or find: 
They are quiet at our feet!" said the Strong Ones,	"We have made them one with stone and clod; 
Serf and laborer and woman, they are less than wise or human - " 
	"I can raise the weak," saith God.

"They are stirring in the dark!" said the Strong Ones,	"They are struggling, who were moveless as the dead, 
We can hear them cry, and strain hand and foot against the chain,	We can hear a heavy upward tread -  
Yet what if they have stirred?" said the Strong Ones,	"What if they have moved beneath the rod? 
Fools and weak and blinded men, we shall tread them down again - "	"Shall ye conquer Me?" saith God.

"They will trample us and bind!" said the Strong Ones:	"We are crushed beneath the blackened feet and hands! 
All the strong and fair and great they will crush from out the State, 	They will whelm it like the weight of sands -  
They are witless and are blind!" said the Strong Ones,	"There is black decay where they have trod -  
They will break the world in twain if their hands are on the rein - "	"What is that to me?" saith God.

"Ye have made them in their strength, who were Strong Ones,	Ye have only taught the blackness ye have known; 
These are evil men and blind? Ay, but molded to your mind!	How can ye cry out against your own? 
Ye have hid the light and love I have given	From the muddied ways where they must plod, 
Ye have builded this your lord with the lash and with the sword - 	Reap what ye have sown!" saith God.
