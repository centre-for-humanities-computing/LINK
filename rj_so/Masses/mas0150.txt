PROMETHEUS

Across the clean canopy of night the mighty 
	planets revolving,
Each on its destined track through trackless space and 
	through incalculable aeons
Measuring miles by the million million, measuring time 
	by the unit of eternity - 
Silent, serene:

In a filthy ten-foot alley the man that cannot grow 
	taller than seventy-two inches, whose brain is 
	compressed in a cell of bone;
Entombed, and tearing the fleshy walls of his tomb 
	with yearnings for an endless life, whose life is 
	three score years and ten;
Wearied if he walk a dozen miles, surrendering to 
	sleep if he remain awake above sixteen hours:

Which is the happier, stronger, greater?
The stars that see not the man, that perform prodigies 
	because they, are ordained to perform them?
Or the man that sees the stars obey and yet refuses 
	to obey?
The stars serve and live,
The man defies and is slain:
But the man defies!
