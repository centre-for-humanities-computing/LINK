IN A MINOR KEY

Love, when I die, your thought of me  
	Shall make the earth a magic bed. 
Though buried in the deepest sea, 
	I shall not join the weary dead.

For you shall make me live and rise, 
	Your thought shall be my blood and 
		breath - And only when your memory dies 
	Will I too die - a double death.
