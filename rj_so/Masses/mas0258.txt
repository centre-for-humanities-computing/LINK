THE BATH

We bathed together. 
We splashed, and slipped, and 
	lost the soap, and laughed. 
Our shoulders shone wet and gleaming. 
Sometimes we kissed. 
The steamy heavy-sweet air stole on our 
	senses.The sudsy water enveloped us like a 
	blanket,Only more closely, more intimately,Its insidious warmth creeping into our	bodies 
Like a narcotic.We almost dozed, with limbs entwined, 
But we were swept by gusts of golden	kisses.
