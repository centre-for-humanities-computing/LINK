A FARMER'S WOMAN

I know a patient, nobly-curving hill 
That wears a different paleness every hour, -  
Copper by sun, grey-velvet through a shower, -  
Topaz and mauve,‚Äîblue of the heron's quill. 
Forever mean-souled ploughmen scar the soil, 
And bind, with rambling stony walls, her breast -  
Never allow her weary womb to rest, 
Nor give a moment's peace for all her toil.

O, if the ploughmen knew what wonders spring 
From fields that for a season fallow lie -  
Under the healing hand of wind and sky -  
Would they not grant her time for flowering! 
Her heart is rock. I wonder if her tongue 
Knows how to say "I also once was young"?
