NOT A SPARROW FALLETH

A decent
 distance from the mercy seat I stood, one judgment day. A little shy,
A little confident. I could rely
 Implicitly upon my winding sheet,

Modish, yet not extreme. Without conceit 
Even such an ultra-nothingness as I 
Might hope for modest quarters in the sky: 
With falling sparrows dared not I compete?

Suddenly stood an old man, noble, blind, 
Before the throne. An angel took his card.
The overtasked Creator read the same,

And reread, puzzled. Then, his head inclined, 
He spoke with much politeness to the bard: 
"John Milton? Yes, I think I've heard your name."
