BLADES OF GRASS

O glorious spring morning! Oh 
base-ball grounds! Oh bill-
boards, and porous underwear ads!  
	A lank Directoire cat emits sundry lurid remarks at my advances: I move onward.
	"O noble Universe! I glory in 
you - " is my exultant cry; "I em-
brace you in all-pervading love -  
love - "
	A violently homely female in Con-
gress gaiters and spectacles glares 
around at me, and strikes the trail 
toward the cop at the Union Square 
corner.
	My being surges with joy; I swing 
my stick in riotous exuberance of 
spring effervescence: (Temperament, 
or something; don't know just what 
I ought to do - but that's the way I 
feel).
	O the Joy of Things! (Nothing 
special, only Things).
	Oh toiling humanity - how I Yearn 
over you! Oh Monstrous System, 
that condemns virile men to labor at 
ledgers and ribbon-counters such
 weather as this!
	A husky red cop suggests that I
accelerate my steps up the Avenue.
	"O Bel oved Brother! O Police 
Force! Would that all Humanity 
might unite today in one glad De-
mocracy and mutual Love! Have you 
never been thrilled by that thought, 
Brother - O my Brother?"
	He says - but I cannot tell you 
what he says; You are too Young -  
too trusting. It is for hardened 
souls alone; he cannot Understand.
	O Noon Whistle! I feel a passion-
ate, pagan, surging Hunger; I spy a 
Lunch joint across the way.
	O Chicken Sandwiches! Is there 
not a common, universal Craving for 
Chicken Sandwiches? I feel myself 
akin to all men - I put not my self 
above even the meanest of men; I 
enter; there are others waiting.
	O Unutterable, Throbbing Sense 
of Unity! This is Too Much.
	Yes, it is a Darn sight too much; 
thirty cents Apiece!
	O High Cost of Everything! Oh 
Grafters! Oh, Food-Sharks!
	I will have Ham instead. 
	The Ham is all out!
	Oh, - !
