THE OLD MOTHER'S DEATH

I mourn for you, mother, mother; 
We have laid your severe face and your clawlike limbs 
And all the righteous disapprobation of your spine, 
And the implacable virtue of your blighted bosom, 
With callas and dainty ferns in a casket of dark wood.

Not, as the unfeeling impious,
To consume with fire; but to hide and mould, darkly.
Not, as the chanting heathen, with incense and roast meats,
But decently, with costlier clothing than you wore to prayers.

My heart is breaking, mother,
And I am thrice bereft, and orphaned, and alone - 
Recalling how you spoke crisply of your faith in God,
With your shamed form, uncleanly prudish, drugged and swathed;
And how your children were repressed, and made unfrank and cold,
And how we grew in fear of sun and rain, and wind and wave,
And held our little mouths up for the dose - 
Your sons, dolefully coarse and early trivial and old;
And your daughters, timid, self-righteous, and futile.

By all the glow and glory of the love-got child, 
Whose full-bosomed mother mated young and thoughtlessly 
With utter faith in Nature's first sweet urge and guiding -  
I cry to God my desolation.

Mother, I cannot weep - 
No blessed tears may come to me, mother of my aborted body 
And ravisher of my violated soul - for I was mute 
And effortless, when it may be you would have listened 
A little, and warmed a little, and somewhat understood, 
If I could, once, have cried out, unashamed, with arms out to your 		heart,
Such as you were, the only mother that we had -  
Ah! mother, mother, I might have tried.
