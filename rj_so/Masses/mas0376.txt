THE ARTIST

In the twenty-first summer of my 
	lifeI dug post-holes for the Telephone Com-
	panySo that I could go to the city in the 
	winter 
And study Art - And I could dig more post-holes 
Than those who were post-hole diggers. 
Now I am in the city 
An artist!And I sometimes wonder if those 
Post-hole diggersThat I could excel at digging post-holes
Might not paint a better picture 
Than I, who am a painter of pic-
	tures. . . .Fate is not cruelBut she has no sense of logic.
