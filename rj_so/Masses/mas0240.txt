LOVE AT SEA

Wind smothers the snarling of the great ships, 
	And the serene gulls are stronger than turbines; 
	Mile upon mile the hiss of a stumbling wave breaks unbroken - 
Yet stronger is the power of your lips for my lips.

This cool green liquid death shall toss us living
	Higher than high heaven and deeper than sighs - 
	But O the abrupt, stiff, sloping, resistless foam 
Shall not forbid our taking and our giving!

Life wrenched from its roots‚Äîwhat wretchedness!
	What waving of lost tentacles like blind sea-things!
	Even the still ooze beneath is quick and profound - 
I am less and more than I was, you are more and less.

I cried upon God last night, and God was not where I cried;
	He was slipping and balancing on the thoughtless shifting planes of 		sea.
	Careless and cruel, he will unchain the appalling sea-gray 			engines - 
But the speech of your body to my body will not be denied!
