THE CHERRY TREE

Joseph was an old man, 
An old man was he; 
He married with Mary, 
The Queen of Glory.

Joseph took Mary 
In the orchard wood,
Where there were apples, plums, cherries, 
As red as any blood.

Then bespoke Mary,
So meek and so mild:
"Get me some cherries,
For my body's bound with child."

Joseph he's taken
These words so unkind:
"Let them get you cherries, Mary,
That did your body bind."

Then bespoke Jesus, 
All in his mother's womb: 
"Go to the tree, Mary, 
And it shall bow down."

The highest bough of the cherry tree 
Shall bow down to Mary's knee,
And she shall have cherries 
For her young son and she.

Mary got cherries
By one, two and three;
Mary got cherries
For her young son and she.
