A SCRUB

There was an old woman crept out with her 
	basket,Late every night with the rise of the moon, 
And where she was going I couldn't but ask it, 
For in her old hand she would carry a broom. 
"Old woman, old woman, old woman," called I, 
"Why do you go in that building so high?" 
"To mop the Philanthropy Offices dry, 
And I shall come down again by and by."
