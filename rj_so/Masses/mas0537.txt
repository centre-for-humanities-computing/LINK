THE SUMMONS

What urged me through sleep to the narrow
	 window?
Towards the east, marches the packed army of the 
	snow,
Crowding the street, from side to side; 
Driving ahead with chilling haste; 
Going to some white splendor, 
Leaving behind a white desolation.

The window panes rattle,
Like drum-beats that echo, off-key;
Calling. . . .
The snow rushes on with a mad purpose 
Gathering recruits as it goes.
Always the drum-taps summon. . . .

What do they ask for? 
Whom are they calling?

I go trembling back to bed,
Stiffened with a cold courage,
And throw warm and defensive arms
Over the body of the man I love,
As he twitches and starts in a restless sleep.
