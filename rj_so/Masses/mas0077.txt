OH, THAT'S DIFFERENT

Would I had learning," said the useless one. 
With scorn we cried, "Arise before the sun 
And go where halls of learning whitely gleam, 
And listen, study, toil and dream!"

"Good fairies, give me riches," whined the shirk.
"Good luck?" we scoffed. "Good fortune?" "Go to work!"

"God give me health," sighed one who sat and ate,
And longing looked within his brimming plate. 
"Go out," we said, "and breathe and bathe and sing, 
"'Tis only effort that such bliss will bring!"

"I long for love," she wrote the shameful line, 
And, shocked, we bade her wait and make no sign!
