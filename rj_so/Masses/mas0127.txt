BOHEMIA - FROM ANOTHER ANGLE

I live in Greenwich Village - I am a young girl‚Äîpassionate, full 
	of desires - In my slope-ceiled attic I work all day,Sometimes singing, sometimes brood-
	ing I have a lover.You hear that?We live together, and I have no wed-
	ding ring . . .Together we live on bread and 
	cheese . . .And dream our fire-tipped dreams.

Me - they call me Rosa, I used to pick o
	lives in Italy . . .My man - his name is Guiseppe - he works in a gang on the rail-
	road. . . .
