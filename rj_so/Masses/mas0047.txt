INTERLUDE

Strange that even here 
	In the shy gray light, 
	Remote,
	Of poplar and hemlock, 
	Friendly to the naked pleasure, of lovers 
	Who have escaped from trim gardens 
	Of dowagers,
	To young girls who have borne
	A little too much from their mothers, - 
	Unseemly this fair quiet should be blurred
	By dim church-music wafting upward
	From pious villages.
	As vapors lift from morning valleys,
	Dissolving in light before they reach the sky,
	So the vague sound passes,
	And the sighing of waters far beneath me.
	And the gurgle of cow-bells
	Resume their gentle spell.
