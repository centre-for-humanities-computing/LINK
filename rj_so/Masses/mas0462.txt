TO A DANCING CHILD

Trippingly trip, unhoused of care,
Let feet fashion gay rhythms rare, 
In and out of the hurrying throng 
Sylph-like weave your way along 
From "L" shadow into the sun, 
Featly foot it till dance is done. 
Poise and pirouette half-clad maid, 
Happy, lightsome and unafraid, 
Scorning beggar and "old-clothes" man, 
Vender, cadet, and garbage can, 
Babies, broker, buggies and thief, 
Rabbi, harlot and gangster chief. 
Merrily skip and trip on toes -  
What's in the future no one knows.
