NOCTURNE

The lake in the moonlight is beautiful as music.
The black silhouettes of the trees 
Seem deep with mystery.
The trees fold and weave about their secrets. 
In their hearts they smile, 
Aloof and wise.
But their branches hide the smiles.

The air is still as though the world 
Were hushed before the loveliness of night. 
Lights are softened in the moonlight, 
A line of hills is touched with light, 
Poured from the great, gold moon.

Yet I have seen the lake like steel 
In a dark day.
Or like heavy, molten metal, 
Throwing thick, chopping waves, 
In futile anger at the heavens. 
The trees, sinister and wild,
Flinging their branches in gesticulation to the wind. 
Disheveled, reckless eucalyptus, 
Flinging their secrets to the wind.

The same lake and the same trees. 
Are the souls of men like these, 
Giving beauty in summer moonlight, -  
Reckless and turbulent in storms?

There are pine trees near the lake. 
Straight and tall as towers.
They bend in the wind, and toss their harried
	branches. 
But I have not seen them angry. 
They know an inner harmony 
With wind and storms and moonlight, 
A cataclysm might uproot them, 
And leave the spirit of the pines inviolate. 
Their secret smiles touched with scorn.
