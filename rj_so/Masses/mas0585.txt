IN A CLASS ROOM

The voices drone serenely through 
	the calm, decorous stillness;
It is something about the work of the 
	early romantic poets,
An enumeration of merits, a grave di-
	scussion of methods.
The professor is very intent on an ac-
	curate classification.
He carefully measures the lines and 
	counts the uses of color.
He summarizes results and reviews his 
	summary.

Out of the window the mountains loom
	blue against the horizon.
 Clouds are touching the pines on the
	hilltop just over the campus. 
A flash of wings, and a bird song trails
	through the April sunshine.
 And the wind, the wind! I can hear it
	with the breath of old springs in its
	calling.
I remember a hedge where the pussy
	willows were blooming, 
And the sun was soft as the feel of
	the fussy, silvery catkins, 
And a road winds on and on and
	through the shimmering, golden
	mesa
.I remember a stream that leaped from
	the rocks and shouted 
Tremulous, vibrant sounds like a half-
	articulate spirit.
And something within me sang and
	danced and wept and was silent.

But I have lost the trend of the early
	romantic movement. 
I am stupidly out of grace with the
	earnest English professor. 
Yet, yonder the lyric limbs of the artist's
	white Greek dancers 
Gleam eternally joyous amid the pale
	olive shadows.
