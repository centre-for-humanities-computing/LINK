author profiling is wrong?
	- but what if it works

The world is statistically biased/sociocultural environment is not unifrom and neither is our perception of

fundamental difference between statistical modelling and machine learning
	- data generating mechanism vs. prediction

where does the accuracy recide, world or model

Technologically primitives can be theoretically or empirically complex 

*Batya Friedman and Hellen Nissenbaum*'s ''Bias in Computer Systems.'' 

Sources:
	1. *Preexisting bias* (data-driven), temming from ''social institutions, practices, and attitudes.''  These biases ''exist independently [of], and usually prior to the creation of the system'' 

	
	2. *Technical bias* -  evidence utilisation that does not follow principles of scientific best practice

	
	3. *Emergent bias*: These biases do not exist (per se) in the technology straight ''out of the box.''  Instead, these biases emerge because of the interaction between the technology and the users

	4. Evidence bias: evidence utilisation that shifts political debates to particular questions or	concerns in a non-transparent way.

Freedom from bias is part of a set of criteria

Parity (fairness):
	- Decisions should be in some sense probabilistically independent of
sensitive features values (such as gender, race)

Misclassifications are extremely interesting, but where do they belong algirithm (what )
